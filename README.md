This is the home of ‘Developing Backbone.js Applications’, an (in-progress) book about the Backbone.js framework for structuring JavaScript applications. It is released under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license.

I am quite pleased to announce that this book will be out in physical form in a few months time via O'Reilly Media. Readers will have the option of purchasing the latest version in either print or a number of digital formats then or can grab a copy for free from this repository.
