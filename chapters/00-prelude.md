## Prelude

![](img/logo.jpg)

In the past, building data-rich web applications with JavaScript was a challenge. The transition from writing an app that requires complete page reloads into something more dynamic often requires rethinking our architecture and it's easy for things to get out of hand if no effort is put into keeping your code organized. We can't just hack together some jQuery code and hope that this will scale as your application grows.

Thankfully, we now have a number of libraries that can help improve the structure and maintainability of our code,
making it easier to build ambitious interfaces without a great deal of effort. [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) is one such foundation for solving these problems and in this book we will be taking you though an in-depth walkthrough of it.

Begin with the fundamentals, work your way through the practicals and learn how to build an application that is both cleanly organized and maintainable. If you are a developer looking to write code that can be more easily read, structured and extended - this guide will hopefully be of help.

Corrections to existing material are always welcome and I hope that together we can provide the community with an up-to-date resource that is of help.

My extended thanks go out to [Jeremy Ashkenas](https://github.com/jashkenas) for creating Backbone.js and [these](https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-fundamentals/contributors) members of the community for their assistance making this project far better than I could have imagined.

## Target Audience

This book is targeted at novice to intermediate developers wishing to learn how to better structure their client-side code. An understanding of JavaScript fundamentals is required to get the most out of it, however we have tried to provide a basic description of these concepts where possible.

## Reading

I assume your level of knowledge about JavaScript goes beyond the basics and as such certain topics such as object literals are skipped. If you need to learn more about the language, I am happy to suggest:
