## Prelude

![](../img/logo.jpg)

Welcome to my (in-progress) book about the [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) library for structuring JavaScript applications. It's released under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported [license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/) meaning you can both grab a copy of the book for free or help to further [improve](https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-fundamentals/) it.

I'm very pleased to announce that this book will be out in physical form (once complete) via [O'Reilly Media](http://oreilly.com). Readers will have the option of purchasing the latest version in either print or a number of digital formats then or can grab a recent version from this repository.

Corrections to existing material are always welcome and I hope that together we can provide the community with an up-to-date resource that is of help.
My extended thanks go out to [Jeremy Ashkenas](https://github.com/jashkenas) for creating Backbone.js and [these](https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-fundamentals/contributors) members of the community for their assistance tweaking this project.

I hope you find this book helpful!
