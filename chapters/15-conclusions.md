# Conclusions


That's it for 'Developing Backbone.js Applications'. I hope you found this book both useful, enlightening and a good start for your journey into exploring Backbone.js.

If there are other topics or areas of this book you feel could be expanded further, please feel free to let me know, or better yet, send a pull request upstream. I'm always interested in making this title as comprehensive as possible.

Until next time, the very best of luck with the rest of your journey!

## Notes

I would like to thank the Backbone.js, Stack Overflow, DailyJS (Alex Young) and JavaScript communities for their help, references and contributions to this book. This project would not be possible without you so thank you! :)
