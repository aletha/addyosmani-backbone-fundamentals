##Introduction

In this mini-book, I'll be covering a complete run-down of Backbone.js; including models, views, collections and routers. I'll also be taking you through advanced topics like modular development with Backbone.js and AMD (with RequireJS), how to solve the routing problems with Backbone and jQuery Mobile, tips about scaffolding tools that can save time setting up your initial application and more.

If this is your first time looking at Backbone.js and you're still unsure whether or not to give it a try, why not take a look at how [a Todo application](http://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc) might be implemented in Backbone and most of the other alternatives before reading further?

The goal of this mini-book is to create a free, centralized repository of information that can help those developing real-world apps with Backbone. If you come across a section or topic which you think could be improved or expanded on, please feel free to submit a pull-request. It won't take long and you'll be helping other developers avoid problems you've run into before.
