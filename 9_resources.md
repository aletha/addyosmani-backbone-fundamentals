Whilst we get with Backbone out of the box can be terribly useful, there are some equally as beneficial add-ons that can help simplify our development process. These include:

* [Backbone Layout Manager](https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone.layoutmanager)
* [Backbone Model Binding](https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.modelbinding)
* [Backbone Relational - for model relationships](https://github.com/PaulUithol/Backbone-relational)
* [View and model inheritance](https://gist.github.com/1271041)
* [Backbone CouchDB](https://github.com/janmonschke/backbone-couchdb)
* [Backbone Validations - HTML5 inspired validations](https://github.com/n-time/backbone.validations)

In time, there will be tutorials in the book covering some of these resources but until then, please feel free to check them out.
