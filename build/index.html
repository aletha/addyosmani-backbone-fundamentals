  ></h2
><p
>In this mini-book, I’ll be covering a complete run-down of Backbone.js; including models, views, collections and routers. I’ll also be taking you through advanced topics like modular development with Backbone.js and AMD (with RequireJS), how to solve the routing problems with Backbone and jQuery Mobile, tips about scaffolding tools that can save time setting up your initial application and more.</p
><p
>If this is your first time looking at Backbone.js and you’re still unsure whether or not to give it a try, why not take a look at how <a href="http://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc"
  >a Todo application</a
  > might be implemented in Backbone and most of the other alternatives before reading further?</p
><p
>The goal of this mini-book is to create a free, centralized repository of information that can help those developing real-world apps with Backbone. If you come across a section or topic which you think could be improved or expanded on, please feel free to submit a pull-request. It won’t take long and you’ll be helping other developers avoid problems you’ve run into before.</p

  >What is Backbone?</a
  ></h3
><p
>Backbone.js is one of a number of JavaScript frameworks for creating MVC-like web applications. On the front-end, it’s my architectural framework of choice as it’s both mature, relatively lightweight and can be easily tested using third-party toolkits such as Jasmine or QUnit. Other MVC options you may be familiar with include Ember.js (SproutCore 2.0), Spine, YUILibrary and JavaScriptMVC.</p
><p
>Backbone is maintained by a number of contributors, most notably: Jeremy Ashkenas, creator of CoffeeScript, Docco and Underscore.js. As Jeremy is a believer in detailed documentation, there’s a level of comfort in knowing you’re unlikely to run into issues which are either not explained in the official docs or which can’t be nailed down with some assistance from the #documentcloud IRC channel. I strongly recommend using the latter if you find yourself getting stuck.</p
><h3 id="why-should-you-consider-using-it"
><a href="#TOC"
  >Why should you consider using it?</a
  ></h3
><p
>Backbone’s main benefits, regardless of your target platform or device, include helping:</p
><ul
><li
  >Organize the structure to your application</li
  ><li
  >Simplify server-side persistence</li
  ><li
  >Decouple the DOM from your page’s data</li
  ><li
  >Model data, views and routers in a succinct manner</li
  ><li
  >Provide DOM, model and collection synchronization</li
  ></ul
><p
>In ways, the real question is why you should consider applying the MVC-pattern to your JavaScript projects and the one word answer is simply structure.</p
><p
>If opting to use jQuery, Zepto or another querySelectorAll-based selection library to produce a non-trivial application it can become very easy to produce an unwieldy amount of code; that is - unless you have a plan for how you’re going to structure and organize your application. Separating concerns into models, views and controllers (or routers) is one way of solving this.</p
><p
>Remember that if you have experience with structuring applications using the MVVM (Model-View ViewModel) pattern, modules or otherwise, these are also equally as valid but do require you to know what you’re doing. For most single-page applications, I find that the MVC pattern works well so Backbone is a perfect fit for our needs.</p

I will also be covering some tips on effective namespacing.</p

>Backbone models contain interactive data for an application as well as the logic around this data. For example, we can use a model to represent the concept of a photo object including its attributes like tags, titles and a location.</p
><p
>Models are quite straight-forward to create and can be constructed by extending <code
  >Backbone.Model</code
  > as follows:</p
><pre
><code
  >var Photo = Backbone.Model.extend({
    defaults: {
        src: 'placeholder.jpg',
        title: 'an image placeholder',
        coordinates: [0,0]
    },
    initialize: function(){
        this.bind(&quot;change:src&quot;, function(){
            var src = this.get(&quot;src&quot;); 
            console.log('Image source updated to ' + src);
        });
    },
    changeSrc: function( source ){
        this.set({ src: source });
    }
});

var somePhoto = new Photo({ src: &quot;test.jpg&quot;, title:&quot;testing&quot;});
somePhoto.changeSrc(&quot;magic.jpg&quot;); // which triggers &quot;change:src&quot; and logs an update message to the console.
</code

  >Initialization</a
  ></h4
><p
>The <code
  >initialize()</code

><pre>
var Photo = Backbone.Model.extend({
    initialize: function(){
        console.log('this model has been initialized');
    }
});

/*We can then create our own instance of a photo as follows:*/
var myPhoto = new Photo();
</pre>
<h4 id="getters-setters"
><a href="#TOC"
  >Getters &amp; Setters</a
  ></h4
><p
><strong
  >Model.get()</strong
  ></p
><p
><code
  >Model.get()</code
  > provides easy access to a model’s attributes. Attributes which are passed through to the model on instantiation are instantly available for retrieval.</p
><pre>
var myPhoto = new Photo({ title: "My awesome photo", 
                          src:"boston.jpg", 
                          location: "Boston", 
                          tags:['the big game', 'vacation']}),

    title = myPhoto.get("title"), //my awesome photo
    location = myPhoto.get("location"), //Boston
    tags = myPhoto.get("tags"), // ['the big game','vacation']
    photoSrc = myPhoto.get("src"); //boston.jpg
</pre>
<p
>Alternatively, if you wish to directly access all of the attributes in an model’s instance directly, you can achieve this as follows:</p
><pre>
var myAttributes = myPhoto.attributes;
console.log(myAttributes);
</pre>
<p
>It is best practice to use <code
  >Model.set()</code
  > or direct instantiation to set the values of a model’s attributes.</p
><p
>Accessing <code
  >Model.attributes</code
  > directly is generally discouraged. Instead, should you need to read or clone data, <code
  >Model.toJSON()</code
  > is recommended for this purpose. If you would like to access or copy a model’s attributes for purposes such as JSON stringification (e.g. for serialization prior to being passed to a view), this can be achieved using <code
  >Model.toJSON()</code
  >:</p
><pre>
var myAttributes = myPhoto.toJSON();
console.log(myAttributes);
/* this returns { title: "My awesome photo", 
             src:"boston.jpg",

             tags:['the big game', 'vacation']}*/
</pre>
<p
><strong
  >Model.set()</strong

var Photo = Backbone.Model.extend({
    initialize: function(){
        console.log('this model has been initialized');
    }
});

/*Setting the value of attributes via instantiation*/
var myPhoto = new Photo({ title: 'My awesome photo', location: 'Boston' });

var myPhoto2 = new Photo();

/*Setting the value of attributes through Model.set()*/
myPhoto2.set({ title:'Vacation in Florida', location: 'Florida' });
</pre>
<p
><strong
  >Default values</strong
  ></p
><p
>There are times when you want your model to have a set of default values (e.g. in a scenario where a complete set of data isn’t provided by the user). This can be set using a property called <code
  >defaults</code
  > in your model.</p
><pre>
var Photo = Backbone.Model.extend({
    defaults:{
        title: 'Another photo!',
        tags:  ['untagged'],

<p

this.bind('change', function(){
    console.log('values for this model have changed');

</pre>
<p

var Photo = Backbone.Model.extend({

<p
><strong
  >Validation</strong
  ></p
><p
>Backbone supports model validation through <code
  >Model.validate()</code
  >, which allows checking the attribute values for a model prior to them being set.</p
><p
>It supports including as complex or terse validation rules against attributes and is quite straight-forward to use. If the attributes provided are valid, nothing should be returned from <code
  >.validate()</code
  >, however if they are invalid a custom error can be returned instead.</p
><p
>A basic example for validation can be seen below:</p
><pre>
var Photo = Backbone.Model.extend({
    validate: function(attribs){
        if(attribs.src === undefined){
            return "Remember to set a source for your image!";
        }
    },

    initialize: function(){
        console.log('this model has been initialized');
        this.bind("error", function(model, error){
            console.log(error);
        });
    }
});

var myPhoto = new Photo();
myPhoto.set({ title: "On the beach" });
</pre>


<h3 id="views"
><a href="#TOC"
  >Views</a
  ></h3
><p
>Views in Backbone don’t contain the markup for your application, but rather they are there to support models by defining how they should be visually represented to the user. This is usually achieved using JavaScript templating (e.g. Mustache, jQuery tmpl etc). When a model updates, rather than the entire page needing to be refreshed, we can simply bind a view’s <code
  >render()</code
  > function to a model’s <code
  >change()</code
  > event, allowing the view to always be up to date.</p
><h4 id="creating-new-views"
><a href="#TOC"
  >Creating new views</a
  ></h4
><p
>Similar to the previous sections, creating a new view is relatively straight-forward. We simply extend <code
  >Backbone.View</code
  >. Here’s an example of a possible implementation of this, which I’ll explain shortly:</p
><pre>
var PhotoSearch = Backbone.View.extend({
    el: $('#results'),
    render: function( event ){
        var compiled_template = _.template( $("#results-template").html() );
        this.el.html( compiled_template(this.model.toJSON()) );
        return this; //recommended as this enables calls to be chained.
    },
    events: {
        "submit #searchForm":  "search",
        "click .reset": "reset",
        "click .advanced": "switchContext"
    },
    search: function( event ){
        //executed when a form '#searchForm' has been submitted
    },
    reset: function( event ){
        //executed when an element with class "reset" has been clicked.
    },
    //etc
});
</pre>
<h4 id="what-is-el"
><a href="#TOC"
  >What is el?</a
  ></h4
><p
><code
  >el</code
  > is basically a reference to a DOM element and all views must have one, however Backbone allows you to specify this in four different ways. You can either directly use an <code

  >className</code

><pre>
el: $('#results')  //select based on an ID or other valid jQuery selector.
tagName: 'li' //select based on a specific tag. Here el itself will be derived from the tagName
className: 'items' //similar to the above, this will also result in el being derived from it
el: '' //defaults to a div without an id, name or class.
</pre>
<p
><strong
  >Note:</strong

  >Understanding <code

><p
><code
  >render()</code
  > is an optional function to define how you would like a template to be rendered. Backbone allows you to use any JavaScript templating solution of your choice for this but for the purposes of this book, we’ll opt for Underscore’s micro-templating.</p
><p
>The <code
  >_.template</code
  > method in underscore compiles JavaScript templates into functions which can be evaluated for rendering. In the above view, I’m passing the markup from a template with id <code
  >results-template</code
  > to be compiled. Next, I set the html for <code
  >el</code
  > (our DOM element for this view) the output of processing a JSON version of the model associated with the view through the compiled template.</p
><p
>Presto! This populates the template, giving you a data-complete set of markup in just a few short lines of code.</p
><p
><strong
  >The <code

><p
>The Backbone <code
  >events</code

  >el</code

  >{&quot;eventName selector&quot;: &quot;callbackFunction&quot;}</code
  > and a number of event-types are supported, including ‘click’, ‘submit’, ‘mouseover’, ‘dblclick’ and more.</p
><p
>What isn’t instantly obvious is that under the bonnet, Backbone uses jQuery’s <code
  >.delegate()</code
  > to provide instant support for event delegation but goes a little further, extending it so that <code
  >this</code
  > always refers to the current view object. The only thing to really keep in mind is that any string callback supplied to the events attribute must have a corresponding function with the same name within the scope of your view otherwise you may incur exceptions.</p

  >Collections</a
  ></h3
><p
>Collections are basically sets of models and can be easily created by extending <code
  >Backbone.Collection</code
  >.</p
><p
>Normally, when creating a collection you’ll also want to pass through a property specifying the model that your collection will contain as well as any instance properties required.</p
><p
>In the following example, we’re creating a PhotoCollection containing the Photo models we previously defined.</p
><pre>
var PhotoCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({
    model: Photo
});
</pre>
<p
><strong
  >Getters and Setters</strong
  ></p
><p
>There are a few different options for retrieving a model from a collection. The most straight-forward is using <code
  >Collection.get()</code
  > which accepts a single id as follows:</p
><pre>
var skiingEpicness = PhotoCollection.get(2);
</pre>
<p
>Sometimes you may also want to get a model based on something called the client id. This is an id that is internally assigned automatically when creating models that have not yet been saved, should you need to reference them. You can find out what a model’s client id is by accessing its <code
  >.cid</code
  > property.</p
><pre>
var mySkiingCrash = PhotoCollection.getByCid(456);
</pre>
<p
>Backbone Collections don’t have setters as such, but do support adding new models via <code
  >.add()</code
  > and removing models via <code
  >.remove()</code
  >.</p
><pre>
var a = new Backbone.Model({ title: 'my vacation'}),
    b = new Backbone.Model({ title: 'my holiday'});

var photoCollection = new PhotoCollection([a,b]);
photoCollection.remove([a,b]);
</pre>
<p
><strong
  >Listening for events</strong
  ></p
><p
>As collections represent a group of items, we’re also able to listen for <code
  >add</code
  > and <code
  >remove</code
  > events for when new models are added or removed from the collection. Here’s an example:</p
><pre>
var PhotoCollection = new Backbone.Collection();
PhotoCollection.bind("add", function(photo) {
  console.log("I liked " + photo.get("title") + ' its this one, right? '  + photo.get("src"));
});

PhotoCollection.add([
  {title: "My trip to Bali", src: "bali-trip.jpg"},
  {title: "The flight home", src: "long-flight-oofta.jpg"},
  {title: "Uploading pix", src: "too-many-pics.jpg"}
]);
</pre>
<p
>In addition, we’re able to bind a <code
  >change</code
  > event to listen for changes to models in the collection.</p
><pre>
PhotoCollection.bind("change:title", function(){
    console.log('there have been updates made to this collections titles');    
});
</pre>
<p
><strong
  >Fetching models from the server</strong
  ></p
><p
><code
  >Collections.fetch()</code
  > provides you with a simple way to fetch a default set of models from the server in the form of a JSON array. When this data returns, the current collection will refresh.</p
><pre>
var PhotoCollection = new Backbone.Collection;
PhotoCollection.url = '/photos';
PhotoCollection.fetch();
</pre>
<p
>Under the covers, <code
  >Backbone.sync</code
  > is the function called every time Backbone tries to read (or save) models to the server. It uses jQuery or Zepto’s ajax implementations to make these RESTful requests, however this can be overridden as per your needs.</p
><p
>In the above fetch example if we wish to log an event when <code
  >.sync()</code
  > gets called, we can simply achieve this as follows:</p

Backbone.sync = function(method, model) {

};
</pre>
<p
><strong
  >Resetting/Refreshing Collections</strong
  ></p
><p
>Rather than adding or removing models individually, you occasionally wish to update an entire collection at once. <code

><pre>
http://unicorns.com/#/whatsup
http://unicorns.com/#/search/seasonal-horns/page2
</pre>
<p
>Note: A router will usually have at least one URL route defined as well as a function that maps what happens when you reach that particular route. This type of key/value pair may resemble:</p
><pre>
"/route" : "mappedFunction"
</pre>
<p
>Let us now define our first controller by extending <code
  >Backbone.Router</code
  >. For the purposes of this guide, we’re going to continue pretending we’re creating a photo gallery application that requires a GalleryRouter.</p
><p
>Note the inline comments in the code example below as they continue the rest of the lesson on routers.</p
><pre>
var GalleryRouter = Backbone.Router.extend({
    /* define the route and function maps for this router */
    routes:{
        "/about" : "showAbout",
        /*Sample usage: http://unicorns.com/#/about"*/

        "/photos/:id" : "getPhoto",
        /*This is an example of using a ":param" variable which allows us to match 
        any of the components between two URL slashes*/
        /*Sample usage: http://unicorns.com/#/photos/5*/

        "/search/:query" : "searchPhotos"
        /*We can also define multiple routes that are bound to the same map function,
        in this case searchPhotos(). Note below how we're optionally passing in a 
        reference to a page number if one is supplied*/
        /*Sample usage: http://unicorns.com/#/search/lolcats*/

        "/search/:query/p:page" : "searchPhotos",
        /*As we can see, URLs may contain as many ":param"s as we wish*/
        /*Sample usage: http://unicorns.com/#/search/lolcats/p1*/

        "/photos/:id/download/*imagePath" : "downloadPhoto",
        /*This is an example of using a *splat. splats are able to match any number of 
        URL components and can be combined with ":param"s*/
        /*Sample usage: http://unicorns.com/#/photos/5/download/files/lolcat-car.jpg*/

        /*If you wish to use splats for anything beyond default routing, it's probably a good 
        idea to leave them at the end of a URL otherwise you may need to apply regular
        expression parsing on your fragment*/

        "*other"    : "defaultRoute"
        //This is a default route with that also uses a *splat. Consider the
        //default route a wildcard for URLs that are either not matched or where
        //the user has incorrectly typed in a route path manually
        /*Sample usage: http://unicorns.com/#/anything*/

    },

    showAbout: function(){
    },

    getPhoto: function(id){
        /* 
        in this case, the id matched in the above route will be passed through
        to our function getPhoto and we can then use this as we please.
        */
        console.log("You are trying to reach photo " + id);
    },

    searchPhotos: function(query, page){
        console.log("Page number: " + page + " of the results for " + query);

});

/* Now that we have a router setup, remember to instantiate it*/

var myGalleryRouter = new GalleryRouter();
</pre>
<p
>Note: In Backbone 0.5+, it’s possible to opt-in for HTML5 pushState support via <code
  >window.history.pushState</code
  >. This effectively permits non-hashtag routes such as http://www.scriptjunkie.com/just/an/example to be supported with automatic degradation should your browser not support it. For the purposes of this tutorial, we won’t be relying on this newer functionality as there have been reports about issues with it under iOS/Mobile Safari. Backbone’s hash-based routes should however suffice for our needs.</p
><h4 id="backbone.history"
><a href="#TOC"
  >Backbone.history</a
  ></h4
><p
>Next, we need to initialize <code
  >Backbone.history</code
  > as it handles <code
  >hashchange</code
  > events in our application. This will automatically handle routes that have been defined and trigger callbacks when they’ve been accessed.</p
><p
>The <code
  >Backbone.history.start()</code
  > method will simply tell Backbone that it’s OK to begin monitoring all <code
  >hashchange</code
  > events as follows:</p
><pre>
Backbone.history.start();
Router.navigate();
</pre>
<p
>As an aside, if you would like to save application state to the URL at a particular point you can use the <code

/*Lets imagine we would like a specific fragment for when a user zooms into a photo*/
zoomPhoto: function(factor){
    this.zoom(factor); //imagine this zooms into the image

<h3 id="namespacing"
><a href="#TOC"
  >Namespacing</a
  ></h3
><p
>When learning how to use Backbone, an important and commonly overlooked area by tutorials is namespacing. If you already have experience with namespacing in JavaScript, the following section will provide some advice on how to specifically apply concepts you know to Backbone, however I will also be covering explanations for beginners to ensure everyone is on the same page.</p
><h4 id="what-is-namespacing"
><a href="#TOC"
  >What is namespacing?</a
  ></h4
><p
>The basic idea around namespacing is to avoid collisions with other objects or variables in the global namespace. They’re important as it’s best to safeguard your code from breaking in the event of another script on the page using the same variable names as you are. As a good ‘citizen’ of the global namespace, it’s also imperative that you do your best to similarly not prevent other developer’s scripts executing due to the same issues.</p
><p
>JavaScript doesn’t really have built-in support for namespaces like other languages, however it does have closures which can be used to achieve a similar effect.</p
><p
>In this section we’ll be taking a look shortly at some examples of how you can namespace your models, views, routers and other components specifically. The patterns we’ll be examining are:</p
><ul
><li
  >Single global variables</li
  ><li
  >Object Literals</li
  ><li
  >Nested namespacing</li
  ></ul
><p
><strong
  >Single global variables</strong
  ></p
><p
>One popular pattern for namespacing in JavaScript is opting for a single global variable as your primary object of reference. A skeleton implementation of this where we return an object with functions and properties can be found below:</p
><pre>
var myApplication = (function(){
    function(){
      // ...
    },
    return {
      // ...
    }
})();
</pre>
<p
>which you’re likely to have seen before. A Backbone-specific example which may be more useful is:</p
><pre>
var myViews = (function(){
    return {
        PhotoView: Backbone.View.extend({ .. }),
        GalleryView: Backbone.View.extend({ .. }),
        AboutView: Backbone.View.extend({ .. });
        //etc.
    };
})();
</pre>
<p
>Here we can return a set of views or even an entire collection of models, views and routers depending on how you decide to structure your application. Although this works for certain situations, the biggest challenge with the single global variable pattern is ensuring that no one else has used the same global variable name as you have in the page.</p
><p
>One solution to this problem, as mentioned by Peter Michaux, is to use prefix namespacing. It’s a simple concept at heart, but the idea is you select a basic prefix namespace you wish to use (in this example, <code
  >myApplication_</code
  >) and then define any methods, variables or other objects after the prefix.</p
><pre>
var myApplication_photoView = Backbone.View.extend({}),
myApplication_galleryView = Backbone.View.extend({});
</pre>
<p
>This is effective from the perspective of trying to lower the chances of a particular variable existing in the global scope, but remember that a uniquely named object can have the same effect. This aside, the biggest issue with the pattern is that it can result in a large number of global objects once your application starts to grow.</p
><p
>For more on Peter’s views about the single global variable pattern, read his <a href="http://michaux.ca/articles/javascript-namespacing"
  >excellent post on them</a
  >.</p
><p
>Note: There are several other variations on the single global variable pattern out in the wild, however having reviewed quite a few, I felt these applied best to Backbone.</p
><p
><strong
  >Object Literals</strong
  ></p
><p
>Object Literals have the advantage of not polluting the global namespace but assist in organizing code and parameters logically. They’re beneficial if you wish to create easily-readable structures that can be expanded to support deep nesting. Unlike simple global variables, Object Literals often also take into account tests for the existence of a variable by the same name so the chances of collision occurring are significantly reduced.</p
><p
>The code at the very top of the next sample demonstrates the different ways in which you can check to see if a namespace already exists before defining it. I commonly use Option 3.</p
><pre>
/*Doesn't check for existence of myApplication*/
var myApplication = {};

/*
Does check for existence. If already defined, we use that instance.
Option 1:   if(!MyApplication) MyApplication = {};
Option 2:   var myApplication = myApplication = myApplication || {}
Option 3:   var myApplication = myApplication || {};
We can then populate our object literal to support models, views and collections (or any data, really):
*/

var myApplication = {
    models : {},
    views : {
        pages : {}
    },
    collections : {}
};
</pre>
<p
>One can also opt for adding properties directly to the namespace (such as your views, in the following example):</p
><pre>
var myGalleryViews = myGalleryViews || {};
myGalleryViews.photoView = Backbone.View.extend({});
myGalleryViews.galleryView = Backbone.View.extend({});
</pre>
<p
>The benefit of this pattern is that you’re able to easily encapsulate all of your models, views, routers etc. in a way that clearly separates them and provides a solid foundation for extending your code.</p
><p
>This pattern has a number of useful applications. It’s often of benefit to decouple the default configuration for your application into a single area that can be easily modified without the need to search through your entire codebase just to alter them - Object Literals work great for this purpose. Here’s an example of a hypothetical Object Literal for configuration:</p
><pre>
var myConfig = {
    language: 'english',
    defaults: {
        enableGeolocation: true,
        enableSharing: false,
        maxPhotos: 20
    },
    theme: {
        skin: 'a',
        toolbars: {
            index: 'ui-navigation-toolbar',
            pages: 'ui-custom-toolbar'    
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p
>Note that there are really only minor syntactical differences between the Object Literal pattern and a standard JSON data set. If for any reason you wish to use JSON for storing your configurations instead (e.g. for simpler storage when sending to the back-end), feel free to.</p
><p
>For more on the Object Literal pattern, I recommend reading Rebecca Murphey’s <a href="http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/2009/10/15/using-objects-to-organize-your-code"
  >excellent article on the topic</a
  >.</p
><p
><strong
  >Nested namespacing</strong
  ></p
><p
>An extension of the Object Literal pattern is nested namespacing. It’s another common pattern used that offers a lower risk of collision due to the fact that even if a namespace already exists, it’s unlikely the same nested children do.</p
><p
>Does this look familiar?</p
><pre>
YAHOO.util.Dom.getElementsByClassName('test');
</pre>
<p
>Yahoo’s YUI uses the nested object namespacing pattern regularly and even DocumentCloud (the creators of Backbone) use the nested namespacing pattern in their main applications. A sample implementation of nested namespacing with Backbone may look like this:</p
><pre>
var galleryApp =  galleryApp || {};

/*perform similar check for nested children*/
galleryApp.routers = galleryApp.routers || {};
galleryApp.model = galleryApp.model || {};
galleryApp.model.special = galleryApp.model.special || {};

/*routers*/
galleryApp.routers.Workspace   = Backbone.Router.extend({}); 
galleryApp.routers.PhotoSearch = Backbone.Router.extend({}); 

/*models*/
galleryApp.model.Photo   = Backbone.Model.extend({});
galleryApp.model.Comment = Backbone.Model.extend({}); 

/*special models*/
galleryApp.model.special.Admin = Backbone.Model.extend({});
</pre>
<p
>This is both readable, organized and is a relatively safe way of namespacing your Backbone application in a similar fashion to what you may be used to in other languages.</p
><p
>The only real caveat however is that it requires your browser’s JavaScript engine first locating the galleryApp object and then digging down until it gets to the function you actually wish to use.</p
><p
>This can mean an increased amount of work to perform lookups, however developers such as Juriy Zaytsev (kangax) have previously tested and found the performance differences between single object namespacing vs the ‘nested’ approach to be quite negligible.</p
><p
><strong
  >Recommendation</strong
  ></p
><p
>Reviewing the namespace patterns above, the option that I would personally use with Backbone is nested object namespacing with the object literal pattern.</p
><p
>Single global variables may work fine for applications that are relatively trivial, however, larger codebases requiring both namespaces and deep sub-namespaces require a succinct solution that promotes readability and scales. I feel this pattern achieves all of these objectives well and is a perfect companion for Backbone development.</p

><p
>It works very well with Backbone, Underscore, jQuery and CoffeeScript and is even used by companies such as Red Bull and Jim Bean.

  >Clarifications on Backbone’s MVC</a
  ></h4
><p
>As Thomas Davis has previously noted, Backbone.js’s MVC is a loose interpretation of traditional MVC, something common to many client-side MVC solutions. Backbone’s views are what could be considered a wrapper for templating solutions such as the Mustache.js and <code
  >Backbone.View</code
  > is the equivalent of a controller in traditional MVC. <code
  >Backbone.Model</code
  > is however the same as a classical ‘model’.</p
><p
>Whilst Backbone is not the only client-side MVC solution that could use some improvements in it’s naming conventions, <code
  >Backbone.Controller</code
  > was probably the most central source of some confusion but has been renamed a router in more recent versions. This won’t prevent you from using Backbone effectively, however this is being pointed out just to help avoid any confusion if for any reason you opt to use an older version of the framework.</p
><p
>The official Backbone docs do attempt to clarify that their routers aren’t really the C in MVC, but it’s important to understand where these fit rather than considering client-side MVC a 1:1 equivalent to the pattern you’ve probably seen in server-side development.</p

>Andrew de Andrade has pointed out that DocumentCloud themselves usually only use a single controller in most of their applications.

><a href="#TOC"
  >Is Backbone too small for my application’s needs?</a

In both, I cover alternative solutions and my thoughts on the suitability of current MVC solutions for scaled application development.</p
><p
>Backbone can be used for building both trivial and complex applications as demonstrated by the many examples Ashkenas has been referencing in the Backbone documentation. As with any MVC framework however, it’s important to dedicate time towards planning out what models and views your application really needs. Diving straight into development without doing this can result in either spaghetti code or a large refactor later on and it’s best to avoid this where possible.</p
><p
>At the end of the day, the key to building large applications is not to build large applications in the first place. If you however find Backbone doesn’t cut it for your requirements I strongly recommend checking out JavaScriptMVC or SproutCore as these both offer a little more than Backbone out of the box. Dojo and Dojo Mobile may also be of interest as these have also been used to build significantly complex apps by other developers.</p

><p
>As you may know, node.js is an event-driven platform (built on the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/v8/design.html"
  >V8</a
  > runtime), designed for writing fast, scalable network applications. It’s reasonably lightweight, efficient and great for real-time applications that are data-intensive.</p
><p
>Express is a small web-development framework written with node.js, based on <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/"
  >Sinatra</a
  >. It supports a number of useful features such as intuitive views, robust routing and a focus on high performance.</p
><p
>Next on the list are MongoDB and Mongoose. MongoDB is an open-source, document-oriented database store designed with scalability and agility in mind. As a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL"
  >noSQL</a
  > database, rather than storing data in tables and rows (something we’re very used to doing with relational databases), with MongoDB we instead store JSON-like documents using dynamic schemas. One of the goals of Mongo is to try bridging the gap between key-value stores (speed, scalability) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database"
  >relational</a
  > databases (rich functionality).</p
><p
>Mongoose is a JavaScript library that simplifies how we interact with Mongo. Like Express, it’s designed to work within the node.js environment and tries to solve some of the complexities with asynchronous data storage by offering a more user-friendly API. It also adds chaining features into the mix, allowing for a slightly more expressive way of dealing with our data.</p
><p
>Jade is a template engine influenced by Haml (which we’ll be looking at later). It’s implemented with JavaScript (and also runs under node). In addition to supporting Express out of the box, it boasts a number of useful features including support for mixins, includes, caching, template inheritance and much more. Whilst abstractions like Jade certainly aren’t for everyone, our practical will cover working both with and without it.</p

  >Practical</a
  ></h3
><p
>For this practical, we’re going to once again look at extending the popular Backbone Todo application. Rather than relying on localStorage for data persistance, we’re going to switch to storing Todos in a MongoDB document-store instead. The code for this practical can be found at: https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-boilerplates/tree/master/option2</p
><p
><strong
  >app.js</strong
  ></p
><p
>(See <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-boilerplates/blob/master/option2/app.js"
  >here</a
  > for the source)</p
><p
>We must first include the node dependencies required by our application. These are Express, Mongoose and Path (a module containing utilities for dealing with file paths.</p
><pre>
var application_root = __dirname,
  express = require("express"),
  path = require("path"),
  mongoose = require('mongoose');
</pre>
<p
>Next, create a new Express server. <code
  >express.createServer()</code
  > is a simple way of creating an instance of express.HTTPServer, which we’ll be using to pass in our routes.</p
><pre>
var app = express.createServer();
</pre>
<p
>After this, connect Mongoose up to a database (in our case, localhost should suffice). Should you require the ability to pass in authentication information, here’s a sample containing all of the supported URL parameters: <code
  >mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database][?options]]</code
  ></p
><pre>
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/my_database');
</pre>
<p
>A Mongoose model for any Todo item can now be easily defined by passing a schema instance to <code
  >mongoose.model</code
  >. In our case the schema covers a Todo item’s <code
  >text</code
  > content, its <code
  >done</code
  > state and <code
  >order</code
  > position in the overall Todo list.</p
><pre>
var Todo = mongoose.model('Todo', new mongoose.Schema({
  text: String,
  done: Boolean,
  order: Number
}));
</pre>
<p
>The <code
  >configure()</code
  > methods allows us to setup what we need for the current environment with our Express server. Note that lower down in the configuration are two view/view related lines. The last one explicitly sets the viewing/templating engine to be used as Jade <code
  >app.set('view engine', 'jade')</code
  >. We can avoid these if we wish to use plain HTML/JS for our templates instead.</p
><pre>
app.configure(function(){
  // the bodyParser middleware parses JSON request bodies
  app.use(express.bodyParser());
  app.use(express.methodOverride());
  app.use(app.router);
  app.use(express.static(path.join(application_root, "public")));
  app.use(express.errorHandler({ dumpExceptions: true, showStack: true }));
  app.set('views', path.join(application_root, "views"));
  app.set('view engine', 'jade')
});

</pre>
<p
>Should you prefer to switch out Jade for an alternative view engine, this can be done fairly trivially. See the section under ‘Templating’ here: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules. For example, to switch to EJS, you would simply write <code
  >app.set('view engine', 'ejs')</code
  ></p
><p
>Express makes use of commong HTTP verbs (get, put, post etc.) to provide easy to use, expressive routing API based on CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete). Below for example, we can define what happens when the browser requests the root ‘/’. As a trivial route in this application, it doesn’t do anything particularly exciting, however getters typically read or retrieve data.</p
><pre>
app.get('/', function(req, res){
  res.send('Hello World');
});
</pre>
<p
>Onto something a little more useful and in our next route, navigating to ‘/todo’ will actually render our Jade view ‘todo.jade’, as seen in the callback. Additional configuration values can be passed as the second parameter, such as the custom title specified below.</p
><pre>
app.get('/todo', function(req, res){
  res.render('todo', {title: "Our sample application"});
});
</pre>
<p
>Next, we can see the first of our ‘/api/’ routes.</p
><pre>
app.get('/api/todos', function(req, res){
  return Todo.find(function(err, todos) {
    return res.send(todos);
  });
});
</pre>
<p
>The calback to our next route supports querying for todos based on a specific ID. The route string itself (once compiled) will be converted from ‘/api/todos/:id’ to a regular expression. As you might have guessed, this is a hint that routes can also be regular expression literals if we wished to do something more complex.</p
><pre>
app.get('/api/todos/:id', function(req, res){
  return Todo.findById(req.params.id, function(err, todo) {
    if (!err) {
      return res.send(todo);
    }
  });
});
</pre>
<p
>Simplarly, we want to support updating todos based on a specific ID as well. The following allows us to query a todo by ID and then update the values of it’s three attributes (text, done, order) easily.</p
><pre>
app.put('/api/todos/:id', function(req, res){
  return Todo.findById(req.params.id, function(err, todo) {
    todo.text = req.body.text;
    todo.done = req.body.done;
    todo.order = req.body.order;
    return todo.save(function(err) {
      if (!err) {
        console.log("updated");
      }
      return res.send(todo);
    });
  });
});
</pre>
<p
>We’ve so far covered requesting todos and updating them, but a core part of the application requires us to insert (or add) new todos to our data-store. Below we can create new <code>Todo</code> models and simply save them.</p
><pre>
app.post('/api/todos', function(req, res){
  var todo;
  todo = new Todo({
    text: req.body.text,
    done: req.body.done,
    order: req.body.order
  });
  todo.save(function(err) {
    if (!err) {
      return console.log("created");
    }
  });
  return res.send(todo);
});
</pre>
<p
>We of course also want to support deleting todos (e.g if a todo has been ‘cleared’, it should be deleted). This also works based on a specific todo ID.</p
><pre>
app.delete('/api/todos/:id', function(req, res){
  return Todo.findById(req.params.id, function(err, todo) {
    return todo.remove(function(err) {
      if (!err) {
        console.log("removed");
        return res.send('')
      }
    });
  });
});
</pre>
<p
>Finally, this last line is to ensure we’re only listening on the port app.js is running.</p

app.listen(3000);

  >script.js</a
  >. In order to change the application to work with our new back-end, we’ll need to make some very minor changes to this.</p
><p
>Reviewing <code
  >window.TodoList</code

window.TodoList = Backbone.Collection.extend({

    // Reference to this collection's model.
    model: Todo,

    // Save all of the todo items under the `"todos"` namespace.
    // Typically, this should be a unique name within your application
    localStorage: new Store("todos"),
</pre>
<p
>In order to switch it over to our RESTful backend, we’re going to make use of the <code

>In the next addition to this section (coming soon), we’ll take a look at a stack consisting of Ruby, Sinatra, Haml and more.</p
><h2 id="modular-javascript"
><a href="#TOC"
  >Modular JavaScript</a
  ></h2
><p
>When we say an application is modular, we generally mean it’s composed of a set of highly decoupled, distinct pieces of functionality stored in modules. As you probably know, loose coupling facilitates easier maintainability of apps by removing dependencies where possible. When this is implemented efficiently, its quite easy to see how changes to one part of a system may affect another.</p
><p
>Unlike some more traditional programming languages however, the current iteration of JavaScript (ECMA–262) doesn’t provide developers with the means to import such modules of code in a clean, organized manner. It’s one of the concerns with specifications that haven’t required great thought until more recent years where the need for more organized JavaScript applications became apparent.</p
><p
>Instead, developers at present are left to fall back on variations of the module or object literal patterns. With many of these, module scripts are strung together in the DOM with namespaces being described by a single global object where it’s still possible to incur naming collisions in your architecture. There’s also no clean way to handle dependency management without some manual effort or third party tools.</p
><p
>Whilst native solutions to these problems will be arriving in ES Harmony, the good news is that writing modular JavaScript has never been easier and you can start doing it today.</p
><p
>In this next part of the book, we’re going to look at how to use AMD modules and RequireJS for cleanly wrapping units of code in your application into managable modules.</p
><h2 id="organizing-modules-with-requirejs-and-amd"
><a href="#TOC"
  >Organizing modules with RequireJS and AMD</a
  ></h2
><p
>In case you haven’t used it before, RequireJS is a popular script loader written by James Burke - a developer who has been quite instrumental in helping shape the AMD module format, which we’ll discuss more shortly. Some of RequireJS’s capabilities include helping to load multiple script files, helping define modules with or without dependencies and loading in non-script dependencies such as text files.</p
><p
>So, why use RequireJS with Backbone? Although Backbone is excellent when it comes to providing a sanitary structure to your applications, there are a few key areas where some additional help could be used:</p
><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"
><li
  >Backbone doesn’t endorse a particular approach to modular-development. Although this means it’s quite open-ended for developers to opt for classical patterns like the module-pattern or Object Literals for structuring their apps (which both work fine), it also means developers aren’t sure of what works best when other concerns come into play, such as dependency management.</li
  ></ol
><p
>RequireJS is compatible with the AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) format, a format which was born from a desire to write something better than the ‘write lots of script tags with implicit dependencies and manage them manually’ approach to development. In addition to allowing you to clearly declare dependencies, AMD works well in the browser, supports string IDs for dependencies, declaring multiple modules in the same file and gives you easy-to-use tools to avoid polluting the global namespace.</p
><ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal"
><li
  >Let’s discuss dependency management a little more as it can actually be quite challenging to get right if you’re doing it by hand. When we write modules in JavaScript, we ideally want to be able to handle the reuse of code units intelligently and sometimes this will mean pulling in other modules at run-time whilst at other times you may want to do this dynamically to avoid a large pay-load when the user first hits your application.</li
  ></ol
><p
>Think about the GMail web-client for a moment. When users initially load up the page on their first visit, Google can simply hide widgets such as the chat module until a user has indicated (by clicking ‘expand’) that they wish to use it. Through dynamic dependency loading, Google could load up the chat module only then, rather than forcing all users to load it when the page first initializes. This can improve performance and load times and can definitely prove useful when building larger applications.</p

The takeaway is that although it’s perfectly fine to develop applications without a script loader or clean module format in place, it can be of significant benefit to consider using these tools in your application development.</p

  >Writing AMD modules with RequireJS</a
  ></h3
><p
>As discussed above, the overall goal for the AMD format is to provide a solution for modular JavaScript that developers can use today. The two key concepts you need to be aware of when using it with a script-loader are a <code
  >define()</code
  > method for facilitating module definition and a <code
  >require()</code
  > method for handling dependency loading. <code
  >define()</code
  > is used to define named or unnamed modules based on the proposal using the following signature:</p
><p
>define( module_id /<em
  >optional</em
  >/, [dependencies] /<em
  >optional</em
  >/, definition function /<em
  >function for instantiating the module or object</em
  >/ );</p
><p
>As you can tell by the inline comments, the <code
  >module_id</code
  > is an optional argument which is typically only required when non-AMD concatenation tools are being used (there may be some other edge cases where it’s useful too). When this argument is left out, we call the module ‘anonymous’. When working with anonymous modules, the idea of a module’s identity is DRY, making it trivial to avoid duplication of filenames and code.</p
><p
>Back to the define signature, the dependencies argument represents an array of dependencies which are required by the module you are defining and the third argument (‘definition function’) is a function that’s executed to instantiate your module. A barebone module (compatible with RequireJS) could be defined using <code
  >define()</code
  > as follows:</p
><p
>// A module ID has been omitted here to make the module anonymous</p
><p
>define([‘foo’, ‘bar’], // module definition function // dependencies (foo and bar) are mapped to function parameters function ( foo, bar ) { // return a value that defines the module export // (i.e the functionality we want to expose for consumption)</p
><pre
><code
  >      // create your module here
      var myModule = {
          doStuff:function(){
              console.log('Yay! Stuff');
          }
      }

      return myModule;
</code
  ></pre
><p
>});</p
><h4 id="alternate-syntax"
><a href="#TOC"
  >Alternate syntax</a
  ></h4
><p
>There is also a <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html#sugar"
  >sugared version</a
  > of <code
  >define()</code
  > available that allows you to declare your dependencies as local variables using <code
  >require()</code
  >. This will feel familiar to anyone who’s used node, and can be easier to add or remove dependencies. Here is the previous snippet using the alternate syntax:</p
><p
>// A module ID has been omitted here to make the module anonymous</p
><p
>define(function(require){ // module definition function // dependencies (foo and bar) are defined as local vars var foo = require(‘foo’), bar = require(‘bar’);</p
><pre
><code
  >      // return a value that defines the module export
      // (i.e the functionality we want to expose for consumption)

      // create your module here
      var myModule = {
          doStuff:function(){
              console.log('Yay! Stuff');
          }
      }

      return myModule;
</code
  ></pre
><p
>});</p
><p
>The <code
  >require()</code
  > method is typically used to load code in a top-level JavaScript file or within a module should you wish to dynamically fetch dependencies. An example of its usage is:</p
><p
>// Consider ‘foo’ and ‘bar’ are two external modules // In this example, the ‘exports’ from the two modules loaded are passed as // function arguments to the callback (foo and bar) // so that they can similarly be accessed</p
><p
>require([‘foo’, ‘bar’], function ( foo, bar ) { // rest of your code here foo.doSomething(); });</p
><p
><strong
  >Wrapping modules, views and other components with AMD</strong
  ></p
><p
>Now that we’ve taken a look at how to define AMD modules, let’s review how to go about wrapping components like views and collections so that they can also be easily loaded as dependencies for any parts of your application that require them. At it’s simplest, a Backbone model may just require Backbone and Underscore.js. These are considered it’s dependencies and so, to write an AMD model module, we would simply do this:</p
><p
>define([‘underscore’, ‘backbone’], function(_, Backbone) { var myModel = Backbone.Model.extend({</p
><pre
><code
  >  // Default attributes 
  defaults: {
    content: &quot;hello world&quot;,
  },

  // A dummy initialization method
  initialize: function() {
    if (!this.get(&quot;content&quot;)) {
      this.set({&quot;content&quot;: this.defaults.content});
    }
  },

  clear: function() {
    this.destroy();
    this.view.remove();
  }

});
return myModel;
</code
  ></pre
><p
>});</p
><p
>Note how we alias Underscore.js’s instance to <code
  >_</code
  > and Backbone to just <code
  >Backbone</code
  >, making it very trivial to convert non-AMD code over to using this module format. For a view which might require other dependencies such as jQuery, this can similarly be done as follows:</p
><p
>define([ ‘jquery’, ‘underscore’, ‘backbone’, ‘collections/mycollection’, ‘views/myview’ ], function($, _, Backbone, myCollection, myView){</p
><pre
><code
  >var AppView = Backbone.View.extend({
...
</code
  ></pre
><p
>Aliasing to the dollar-sign (<code
  >$</code
  >), once again makes it very easy to encapsulate any part of an application you wish using AMD.</p
><h2 id="external-underscorehandlebarsmustache-templates-using-requirejs"
><a href="#TOC"
  >External [Underscore/Handlebars/Mustache] templates using RequireJS</a
  ></h2
><p
>Moving your [Underscore/Mustache/Handlebars] templates to external files is actually quite straight-forward. As this application makes use of RequireJS, I’ll discuss how to implement external templates using this specific script loader.</p
><p
>RequireJS has a special plugin called text.js which is used to load in text file dependencies. To use the text plugin, simply follow these simple steps:</p
><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"
><li
  ><p
    >Download the plugin from http://requirejs.org/docs/download.html#text and place it in either the same directory as your application’s main JS file or a suitable sub-directory.</p
    ></li
  ><li
  ><p
    >Next, include the text.js plugin in your initial RequireJS configuration options. In the code snippet below, we assume that RequireJS is being included in our page prior to this code snippet being executed. Any of the other scripts being loaded are just there for the sake of example.</p
    ></li
  ></ol
><p
>require.config( { paths: { ‘backbone’: ‘libs/AMDbackbone–0.5.3’, ‘underscore’: ‘libs/underscore–1.2.2’, ‘text’: ‘libs/require/text’, ‘jquery’: ‘libs/jQuery–1.7.1’, ‘json2’: ‘libs/json2’, ‘datepicker’: ‘libs/jQuery.ui.datepicker’, ‘datepickermobile’: ‘libs/jquery.ui.datepicker.mobile’, ‘jquerymobile’: ‘libs/jquery.mobile–1.0’ }, baseUrl: ‘app’ });</p
><ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal"
><li
  >When the <code
    >text!</code
    > prefix is used for a dependency, RequireJS will automatically load the text plugin and treat the dependency as a text resource. A typical example of this in action may look like..</li
  ></ol
><p
>require([‘js/app’, ‘text!templates/mainView.html’], function(app, mainView){ // the contents of the mainView file will be // loaded into mainView for usage. } );</p
><ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal"
><li
  >Finally we can use the text resource that’s been loaded for templating purposes. You’re probably used to storing your HTML templates inline using a script with a specific identifier.</li
  ></ol
><p
>With Underscore.js’s micro-templating (and jQuery) this would typically be:</p
><p
>HTML:</p
><script type="text/template" id="mainViewTemplate">
      <% _.each( person, function( person_item ){ %>
          <li><%= person_item.get("name") %></li>  
      <% }); %>
  </script>

<p
>JS:</p
><p
>var compiled_template = _.template( $(‘#mainViewTemplate’).html() );</p
><p
>With RequireJS and the text plugin however, it’s as simple as saving your template into an external text file (say, <code
  >mainView.html</code
  >) and doing the following:</p
><p
>require([‘js/app’, ‘text!templates/mainView.html’], function(app, mainView){</p
><pre
><code
  >      var compiled_template = _.template( mainView );
  }
</code
  ></pre
><p
>);</p
><p
>That’s it!. You can then go applying your template to a view in Backbone doing something like:</p
><p
>collection.someview.el.html( compiled_template( { results: collection.models } ) );</p
><p
>All templating solutions will have their own custom methods for handling template compilation, but if you understand the above, substituting Underscore’s micro-templating for any other solution should be fairly trivial.</p
><p
><strong
  >Note:</strong
  > You may also be interested in looking at <a href="https://github.com/ZeeAgency/requirejs-tpl"
  >Require.js tpl</a
  >. It’s an AMD-compatible version of the Underscore templating system that also includes support for optimization (pre-compiled templates) which can lead to better performance and no evals. I have yet to use it myself, but it comes as a recommended resource.</p
><h2 id="optimizing-backbone-apps-for-production-with-the-requirejs-optimizer"
><a href="#TOC"
  >Optimizing Backbone apps for production with the RequireJS Optimizer</a
  ></h2
><p
>As experienced developers may know, an essential final step when writing both small and large JavaScript web applications is the build process. The majority of non-trivial apps are likely to consist of more than one or two scripts and so optimizing, minimizing and concatenating your scripts prior to pushing them to production will require your users to download a reduced number (if not just one) script file.</p
><p
>Note: If you haven’t looked at build processes before and this is your first time hearing about them, you might find <a href="http://addyosmani.com/blog/client-side-build-process/"
  >my post and screencast on this topic</a
  > useful.</p
><p
>With some other structural JavaScript frameworks, my recommendation would normally be to implicitly use YUI Compressor or Google’s closure compiler tools, but we have a slightly more elegant method available, when it comes to Backbone if you’re using RequireJS. RequireJS has a command line optimization tool called r.js which has a number of capabilities, including:</p
><ul
><li
  >Concatenating specific scripts and minifiying them using external tools such as UglifyJS (which is used by default) or Google’s Closure Compiler for optimal browser delivery, whilst preserving the ability to dynamically load modules</li
  ><li
  >Optimizing CSS and stylesheets by inlining CSS files imported using @import, stripping out comments etc.</li
  ><li
  >The ability to run AMD projects in both Node and Rhino (more on this later)</li
  ></ul
><p
>You’ll notice that I mentioned the word ‘specific’ in the first bullet point. The RequireJS optimizer only concatenates module scripts that have been specified in arrays of string literals passed to top-level (i.e non-local) require and define calls. As clarified by the <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html"
  >optimizer docs</a
  > this means that Backbone modules defined like this:</p
><p
>define([‘jquery’,‘backbone’,‘underscore’, ‘collections/sample’,‘views/test’], function($,Backbone, _, Sample, Test){ //… });</p
><p
>will combine fine, however inline dependencies such as:</p
><p
>var models = someCondition ? [‘models/ab’,‘models/ac’] : [‘models/ba’,‘models/bc’];</p
><p
>will be ignored. This is by design as it ensures that dynamic dependency/module loading can still take place even after optimization.</p
><p
>Although the RequireJS optimizer works fine in both Node and Java environments, it’s strongly recommended to run it under Node as it executes significantly faster there. In my experience, it’s a piece of cake to get setup with either environment, so go for whichever you feel most comfortable with.</p
><p
>To get started with r.js, grab it from the <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/download.html#rjs"
  >RequireJS download page</a
  > or <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html#download"
  >through NPM</a
  >. Now, the RequireJS optimizer works absolutely fine for single script and CSS files, but for most cases you’ll want to actually optimize an entire Backbone project. You <em
  >could</em
  > do this completely from the command-line, but a cleaner option is using build profiles.</p
><p
>Below is an example of a build file taken from the modular jQuery Mobile app referenced later in this book. A <strong
  >build profile</strong
  > (commonly named <code
  >app.build.js</code
  >) informs RequireJS to copy all of the content of <code
  >appDir</code
  > to a directory defined by <code
  >dir</code
  > (in this case <code
  >../release</code
  >). This will apply all of the necessary optimizations inside the release folder. The <code
  >baseUrl</code
  > is used to resolve the paths for your modules. It should ideally be relative to <code
  >appDir</code
  >.</p
><p
>Near the bottom of this sample file, you’ll see an array called <code
  >modules</code
  >. This is where you specify the module names you wish to have optimized. In this case we’re optimizing the main application called ‘app’, which maps to <code
  >appDir/app.js</code
  >. If we had set the <code
  >baseUrl</code
  > to ‘scripts’, it would be mapped to <code
  >appDir/scripts/app.js</code
  >.</p
><p
>({ appDir: “./”, baseUrl: “./”, dir: “../release”, paths: { ‘backbone’: ‘libs/AMDbackbone–0.5.3’, ‘underscore’: ‘libs/underscore–1.2.2’, ‘jquery’: ‘libs/jQuery–1.7.1’, ‘json2’: ‘libs/json2’, ‘datepicker’: ‘libs/jQuery.ui.datepicker’, ‘datepickermobile’: ‘libs/jquery.ui.datepicker.mobile’, ‘jquerymobile’: ‘libs/jquery.mobile–1.0’ }, optimize: “uglify”, modules: [ { name: “app”, exclude: [ // If you prefer not to include certain libs exclude them here ] } ] })</p
><p
>The way the build system in r.js works is that it traverses app.js (whatever modules you’ve passed) and resolved dependencies, concatenating them into the final <code
  >release</code
  >(dir) folder. CSS is treated the same way.</p
><p
>The build profile is usually placed inside the ‘scripts’ or ‘js’ directory of your project. As per the docs, this file can however exist anywhere you wish, but you’ll need to edit the contents of your build profile accordingly.</p
><p
>Finally, to run the build, execute the following command once insice your <code
  >appDir</code
  > or <code
  >appDir/scripts</code
  > directory:</p
><p
>node ../../r.js -o app.build.js</p
><p
>That’s it. As long as you have UglifyJS/Closure tools setup correctly, r.js should be able to easily optimize your entire Backbone project in just a few key-strokes.

><h3 id="overview"
><a href="#TOC"
  >Overview</a
  ></h3
><p
>Writing a ‘modular’ Backbone application can be a straight-forward process. There are however, some key conceptual differences to be aware of if opting to use AMD as your module format of choice:</p
><ul
><li
  >As AMD isn’t a standard native to JavaScript or the browser, it’s necessary to use a script loader (such as RequireJS or curl.js) in order to support defining components and modules using this module format. As we’ve already reviewed, there are a number of advantages to using the AMD as well as RequireJS to assist here.</li
  ><li
  >Models, views, controllers and routers need to be encapsulated <em
    >using</em
    > the AMD-format. This allows each component of our Backbone application to cleanly manage dependencies (e.g collections required by a view) in the same way that AMD allows non-Backbone modules to.</li
  ><li
  >Non-Backbone components/modules (such as utilities or application helpers) can also be encapsulated using AMD. I encourage you to try developing these modules in such a way that they can both be used and tested independent of your Backbone code as this will increase their ability to be re-used elsewhere.</li
  ></ul
><p
>Now that we’ve reviewed the basics, let’s take a look at developing our application. For reference, the structure of our app is as follows:</p
><p
>index.html …js/ main.js …/models todo.js …/views app.js todos.js …/collections todos.js …/templates stats.html todos.html ../libs …/backbone …/jquery …/underscore …/require require.js text.js …css/</p
><h3 id="markup"
><a href="#TOC"
  >Markup</a
  ></h3
><p
>The markup for the application is relatively simple and consists of three primary parts: an input section for entering new todo items (<code
  >create-todo</code
  >), a list section to display existing items (which can also be edited in-place) (<code
  >todo-list</code
  >) and finally a section summarizing how many items are left to be completed (<code
  >todo-stats</code
  >).</p
><pre>
&lt;div id=&quot;todoapp&quot;&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;

        &lt;div id=&quot;create-todo&quot;&gt;
          &lt;input id=&quot;new-todo&quot; placeholder=&quot;What needs to be done?&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;ui-tooltip-top&quot;&gt;Press Enter to save this task&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div id=&quot;todos&quot;&gt;
          &lt;ul id=&quot;todo-list&quot;&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div id=&quot;todo-stats&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

><h3 id="configuration-options"
><a href="#TOC"
  >Configuration options</a
  ></h3
><p
>If you’ve read the earlier chapter on AMD, you may have noticed that explicitly needing to define each dependency a Backbone module (view, collection or other module) may require with it can get a little tedious. This can however be improved.</p
><p
>In order to simplify referencing common paths the modules in our application may use, we use a RequireJS <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#config"
  >configuration object</a
  >, which is typically defined as a top-level script file. Configuration objects have a number of useful capabilities, the most useful being mode name-mapping. Name-maps are basically a key:value pair, where the key defines the alias you wish to use for a path and key represents the true location of the path.</p
><p
>In the code-sample below, you can see some typical examples of common name-maps which include: <code
  >backbone</code
  >, <code
  >underscore</code
  >, <code
  >jquery</code
  > and depending on your choice, the RequireJS <code
  >text</code
  > plugin, which assists with loading text assets like templates.</p
><p
><strong
  >main.js</strong
  ></p
><p
>require.config({ baseUrl:’../’, paths: { jquery: ‘libs/jquery/jquery-min’, underscore: ‘libs/underscore/underscore-min’, backbone: ‘libs/backbone/backbone-optamd3-min’, text: ‘libs/require/text’ } });</p
><p
>require([‘views/app’], function(AppView){ var app_view = new AppView; });</p
><p
>The <code
  >require()</code
  > at the end of our main.js file is simply there so we can load and instantiation the primary view for our application (<code
  >views/app.js</code
  >). You’ll commonly see both this and the configuration object included the most top-level script file for a project.</p
><p
>In addition to offering name-mapping, the configuration object can be used to define additional properties such as <code
  >waitSeconds</code
  > - the number of seconds to wait before script loading times out and <code
  >locale</code
  >, should you wish to load up i18n bundles for custom languages. The <code
  >baseUrl</code
  > is simply the path to use for module lookups.</p

  >Modularizing our models, views and collections</a
  ></h3
><p
>Before we dive into AMD-wrapped versions of our Backbone components, let’s review a sample of a non-AMD view. The following view listens for changes to it’s model (a Todo item) and re-renders if a user edits the value of the item.</p
><p
>var TodoView = Backbone.View.extend({</p
><pre
><code
  >  //... is a list tag.
  tagName:  &quot;li&quot;,

  // Cache the template function for a single item.
  template: _.template($('#item-template').html()),

  // The DOM events specific to an item.
  events: {
    &quot;click .check&quot;              : &quot;toggleDone&quot;,
    &quot;dblclick div.todo-content&quot; : &quot;edit&quot;,
    &quot;click span.todo-destroy&quot;   : &quot;clear&quot;,
    &quot;keypress .todo-input&quot;      : &quot;updateOnEnter&quot;
  },

  // The TodoView listens for changes to its model, re-rendering. Since there's
  // a one-to-one correspondence between a **Todo** and a **TodoView** in this
  // app, we set a direct reference on the model for convenience.
  initialize: function() {
    _.bindAll(this, 'render', 'close');
    this.model.bind('change', this.render);
    this.model.view = this;
  },
  ...
</code
  ></pre
><p
>Note how for templating the common practice of referencing a script by an ID (or other selector) and obtaining it’s value is used. This of course requires that the template being accessed is implicitly defined in our markup. The following is the ‘embedded’ version of our template being referenced above:</p
><pre>
&lt;script type=&quot;text/template&quot; id=&quot;item-template&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;todo &lt;%= done ? &#39;done&#39; : &#39;&#39; %&gt;&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;display&quot;&gt;
          &lt;input class=&quot;check&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; &lt;%= done ? &#39;checked=&quot;checked&quot;&#39; : &#39;&#39; %&gt; /&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;todo-content&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;todo-destroy&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;edit&quot;&gt;
          &lt;input class=&quot;todo-input&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; value=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p
>Whilst there is nothing wrong with the template itself, once we begin to develop larger applications requiring multiple templates, including them all in our markup on page-load can quickly become both unmanageable and come with performance costs. We’ll look at solving this problem in a minute.</p
><p
>Let’s now take a look at the AMD-version of our view. As discussed earlier, the ‘module’ is wrapped using AMD’s <code

><p
>In this section we’ll discuss applying some of the concepts I cover in my article on <a href="http://addyosmani.com/largescalejavascript"
  >Large-scale JavaScript Application development</a
  > to Backbone.</p
><h3 id="summary"
><a href="#TOC"
  >Summary</a
  ></h3
><p
>At a high-level, one architecture that works for such applications is something which is:</p
><ul
><li
  ><strong
    >Highly decoupled</strong
    >: encouraging modules to only publish and subscribe to events of interest rather than directly communicating with each other. This helps us to build applications which who’s units of code aren’t highly tied (coupled) together and can thus be reused more easily.</li
  ><li
  ><strong
    >Supports module-level security</strong
    >: whereby modules are only able to execute behaviour they’ve been permitted to. Application security is an area which is often overlooked in JavaScript applications, but can be quite easily implemented in a flexible manner.</li
  ><li
  ><strong
    >Supports failover</strong
    >: allowing an application continuing to function even if particular modules fail. The typical example I give of this is the GMail chat widget. Imagine being able to build applications in a way that if one widget on the page fails (e.g chat), the rest of your application (mail) can continue to function without being affected.</li
  ></ul
><p
>This is an architecture which has been implemented by a number of different companies in the past, including Yahoo! (for their modularized homepage - which Nicholas Zakas has <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXjVFPosQHw"
  >spoken</a
  > about) and AOL for some of our upcoming projects.</p
><p
>The three design patterns that make this architecture possible are the:</p
><ul
><li
  ><strong
    >Module pattern</strong
    >: used for encapsulating unique blocks of code, where functions and variables can be kept either public or private. (‘private’ in the simulation of privacy sense, as of course don’t have true privacy in JavaScript)</li
  ><li
  ><strong
    >Mediator pattern</strong
    >: used when the communication between modules may be complex, but is still well defined. If it appears a system may have too many relationships between modules in your code, it may be time to have a central point of control, which is where the pattern fits in.</li
  ><li
  ><strong
    >Facade pattern</strong
    >: used for providing a convenient higher-level interface to a larger body of code, hiding its true underlying complexity</li
  ></ul
><p
>Their specific roles in this architecture can be found below.</p
><ul
><li
  ><strong
    >Modules</strong
    >: There are almost two concepts of what defines a module. As AMD is being used as a module wrapper, technically each model, view and collection can be considered a module. We then have the concept of modules being distinct blocks of code outside of just MVC/MV*. For the latter, these types of ‘modules’ are primarily concerned with broadcasting and subscribing to events of interest rather than directly communicating with each other.They are made possible through the Mediator pattern.</li
  ><li
  ><strong
    >Mediator</strong
    >: The mediator has a varying role depending on just how you wish to implement it. In my article, I mention using it as a module manager with the ability to start and stop modules at will, however when it comes to Backbone, I feel that simplifying it down to the role of a central ‘controller’ that provides pub/sub capabilities should suffice. One can of course go all out in terms of building a module system that supports module starting, stopping, pausing etc, however the scope of this is outside of this chapter.</li
  ><li
  ><strong
    >Facade</strong
    >: This acts as a secure middle-layer that both abstracts an application core (Mediator) and relays messages from the modules back to the Mediator so they don’t touch it directly. The Facade also performs the duty of application security guard; it checks event notifications from modules against a configuration (permissions.js, which we will look at later) to ensure requests from modules are only processed if they are permitted to execute the behaviour passed.</li
  ></ul
><p
>For ease of reference, I sometimes refer to these three patterns grouped together as Aura (a word that means subtle, luminous light).</p
><h3 id="practical-1"
><a href="#TOC"
  >Practical</a
  ></h3
><p
>For the practical section of this chapter, we’ll be extending the well-known Backbone Todo application using the three patterns mentioned above. The complete code for this section can be found here: https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-aura and should ideally be run on at minimum, a local HTTP server.</p
><p
>The application is broken down into AMD modules that cover everything from Backbone models through to application-level modules. The views publish events of interest to the rest of the application and modules can then subscribe to these event notifications.</p
><p
>All subscriptions from modules go through a facade (or sandbox). What this does is check against the subscriber name and the ‘channel/notification’ it’s attempting to subscribe to. If a channel <em
  >doesn’t</em
  > have permissions to be subscribed to (something established through permissions.js), the subscription isn’t permitted.</p

><strong
  >Mediator</strong
  ></p
><p
>Found in <code
  >aura/mediator.js</code
  ></p
><p
>Below is a very simple AMD-wrapped implementation of the mediator pattern, based on prior work by Ryan Florence. It accepts as it’s input an object, to which it attaches <code
  >publish()</code
  > and <code
  >subscribe()</code
  > methods. In a larger application, the mediator can contain additional utilities, such as handlers for initialising, starting and stopping modules, but for demonstration purposes, these two methods should work fine for our needs.</p

  >Facade</strong
  ></p
><p
>Found in <code
  >aura/facade.js</code
  ></p
><p
>Next, we have an implementation of the facade pattern. Now the classical facade pattern applied to JavaScript would probably look a little like this:</p
><p
>var module = (function() { var _private = { i:5, get : function() { console.log(‘current value:’ + this.i); }, set : function( val ) { this.i = val; }, run : function() { console.log(‘running’); }, jump: function(){ console.log(‘jumping’); } }; return { facade : function( args ) { _private.set(args.val); _private.get(); if ( args.run ) { _private.run(); } } } }());</p
><p
>module.facade({run: true, val:10}); //outputs current value: 10, running</p
><p
>It’s effectively a variation of the module pattern, where instead of simply returning an interface of supported methods, your API can completely hide the true implementation powering it, returning something simpler. This allows the logic being performed in the background to be as complex as necessary, whilst all the end-user experiences is a simplified API they pass options to (note how in our case, a single method abstraction is exposed). This is a beautiful way of providing APIs that can be easily consumed.</p
><p
>That said, to keep things simple, our implementation of an AMD-compatible facade will act a little more like a proxy. Modules will communicate directly through the facade to access the mediator’s <code
  >publish()</code
  > and <code
  >subscribe()</code
  > methods, however, they won’t as such touch the mediator directly.This enables the facade to provide application-level validation of any subscriptions and publications made.</p
><p
>It also allows us to implement a simple, but flexible, permissions checker (as seen below) which will validate subscriptions made against a permissions configuration to see whether it’s permitted or not.</p
><p

><p
>For example, when a user enters in a new piece of text for a Todo item and hits ‘enter’ the application publishes a notification saying two things: a) a new Todo item is available and b) the text content of the new item is X. It’s then left up to the rest of the application to do with this information whatever it wishes.</p
><p
>In order to update your Backbone application to primarily use pub/sub, a lot of the work you may end up doing will be moving logic coupled inside of specific views to modules outside of it which are reactionary.</p
><p
>Take the <code
  >todoSaver</code

  ></h3
><p
>The first major hurdle developers typically run into when building Backbone applications with jQuery Mobile is that both frameworks have their own opinions about how to handle application navigation.</p
><p
>Backbone’s routers offer an explicit way to define custom navigation routes through <code
  >Backbone.Router</code
  >, whilst jQuery Mobile encourages the use of URL hash fragments to reference separate ‘pages’ or views in the same document. jQuery Mobile also supports automatically pulling in external content for links through XHR calls meaning that there can be quite a lot of inter-framework confusion about what a link pointing at ‘#/photo/id’ should actually be doing.</p
><p
>Some of the solutions that have been previously proposed to work-around this problem included manually patching Backbone or jQuery Mobile. I discourage opting for these techniques as it becomes necessary to manually patch your framework builds when new releases get made upstream.</p
><p
>There’s also <a href="https://github.com/azicchetti/jquerymobile-router"
  >jQueryMobile router</a
  >, which tries to solve this problem differently, however I think my proposed solution is both simpler and allows both frameworks to cohabit quite peacefully without the need to extend either. What we’re after is a way to prevent one framework from listening to hash changes so that we can fully rely on the other (e.g. <code
  >Backbone.Router</code
  >) to handle this for us exclusively.</p
><p
>Using jQuery Mobile this can be done by setting:</p
><pre
><code
  >$.mobile.hashListeningEnabled = false;
</code
  ></pre
><p
>prior to initializing any of your other code.</p
><p
>I discovered this method looking through some jQuery Mobile commits that didn’t make their way into the official docs, but am happy to see that they are now covered here http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/globalconfig.html in more detail.</p
><p
>The next question that arises is, if we’re preventing jQuery Mobile from listening to URL hash changes, how can we still get the benefit of being able to navigate to other sections in a document using the built-in transitions and effects supported? Good question. This can now be solve by simply calling <code
  >$.mobile.changePage()</code
  > as follows:</p
><pre
><code
  >var url = '#about',
    effect = 'slideup',
    reverse = false,

  >Namespacing</strong
  ></p
><p
>For this application, I opted for the nested namespacing pattern. Implemented correctly, this enables you to clearly identify if items being referenced in your app are views, other modules and so on. This initial structure is a sane place to also include application defaults (unless you prefer maintaining those in a separate file).</p
><pre

  >window.mobileSearch = window.mobileSearch || {
    views: {
        appview: new AppView
    },

        minDate:'01/01/1970'
    }
}
</code
  ></pre
><p
><strong
  >Models</strong
  ></p
><p
>In the Flickly application, there are at least two unique types of data that need to be modelled - search results and individual photos, both of which contain additional meta-data like photo titles. If you simplify this down, search results are actually groups of photos in their own right, so the application only requires:</p
><ul
><li
  >A single model (a photo or ‘result’ entry)</li
  ><li
  >A result collection (containing a group of result entries) for search results</li
  ><li
  >A photo collection (containing one or more result entries) for individual photos or photos with more than one image</li
  ></ul
><p
><strong
  >Views</strong
  ></p
><p
>The views we’ll need include an application view, a search results view and a photo view. Static views or pages of the single-page application which do not require a dynamic element to them (e.g an ‘about’ page) can be easily coded up in your document’s markup, independant of Backbone.</p
><p
><strong
  >Routers</strong
  ></p
><p
>A number of possible routes need to be taken into consideration:</p
><ul
><li
  >Basic search queries <code
    >#search/kiwis</code
    ></li
  ><li
  >Search queries with additional parameters (e.g sort, pagination) <code
    >#search/kiwis/srelevance/p7</code
    ></li
  ><li
  >Queries for specific photos <code
    >#photo/93839</code
    ></li
  ><li
  >A default route (no parameters passed)</li
  ></ul

  >jQuery Mobile: Going beyond mobile application development</a
  ></h3
><p
>The majority of jQM apps I’ve seen in production have been developed for the purpose of providing an optimal experience to users on mobile devices. Given that the framework was developed for this purpose, there’s nothing fundamentally wrong with this, but many developers forget that jQM is a UI framework not dissimilar to jQuery UI. It’s using the widget factory and is capable of being used for a lot more than we give it credit for.</p
><p
>If you open up Flickly in a desktop browser, you’ll get an image search UI that’s modelled on Google.com, however, review the components (buttons, text inputs, tabs) on the page for a moment. The desktop UI doesn’t look anything like a mobile application yet I’m still using jQM for theming mobile components; the tabs, date-picker, sliders - everything in the desktop UI is re-using what jQM would be providing users on mobile devices. Thanks to some media queries, the desktop UI can make optimal use of whitespace, expanding component blocks out and providing alternative layouts whilst still making use of jQM as a component framework.</p
><p
>The benefit of this is that I don’t need to go pulling in jQuery UI separately to be able to take advantage of these features. Thanks to the recent ThemeRoller my components can look pretty much exactly how I would like them to and users of the app can get a jQM UI for lower-resolutions and a jQM-ish UI for everything else.</p
><p
>The takeaway here is just to remember that if you’re not (already) going through the hassle of conditional script/style loading based on screen-resolution (using matchMedia.js etc), there are simpler approaches that can be taken to cross-device component theming.</p

  >Unit Testing Backbone Applications With Jasmine</a
  ></h1
><h2 id="introduction-1"
><a href="#TOC"
  >Introduction</a
  ></h2
><p
>One definition of unit testing is the process of taking the smallest piece of testable code in an application, isolating it from the remainder of your codebase and determining if it behaves exactly as expected. In this section, we’ll be taking a look at how to unit test Backbone applications using a popular JavaScript testing framework called <a href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/"
  >Jasmine</a
  > from Pivotal Labs.</p
><p
>For an application to be considered ‘well’-tested, distinct functionality should ideally have its own separate unit tests where it’s tested against the different conditions you expect it to work under. All tests must pass before functionality is considered ‘complete’. This allows developers to both modify a unit of code and it’s dependencies with a level of confidence about whether these changes have caused any breakage.</p
><p
>As a basic example of unit testing is where a developer may wish to assert whether passing specific values through to a sum function results in the correct output being returned. For an example more relevant to this book, we may wish to assert whether a user adding a new Todo item to a list correctly adds a Model of a specific type to a Todos Collection.</p
><p
>When building modern web-applications, it’s typically considered best-practice to include automated unit testing as a part of your development process. Whilst we’ll be focusing on Jasmine as a solution for this, there are a number of other alternatives worth considering, including QUnit.</p
><h2 id="jasmine"
><a href="#TOC"
  >Jasmine</a
  ></h2
><p
>Jasmine describes itself as a behaviour-driven development (BDD) framework for testing JavaScript code. Before we jump into how the framework works, it’s useful to understand exactly what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development"
  >BDD</a
  > is.</p
><p
>BDD is a second-generation testing approach first described by <a href="http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/"
  >Dan North</a
  > (the authority on BDD) which attempts to test the behaviour of software. It’s considered second-generation as it came out of merging ideas from Domain driven design (DDD) and lean software development, helping teams to deliver high quality software by answering many of the more confusing questions early on in the agile process. Such questions commonly include those concerning documentation and testing.</p
><p
>If you were to read a book on BDD, it’s likely to also be described as being ‘outside-in and pull-based’. The reason for this is that it borrows the idea of of pulling features from Lean manufacturing which effectively ensures that the right software solutions are being written by a) focusing on expected outputs of the system and b) ensuring these outputs are achieved.</p
><p
>BDD recognizes that there are usually multiple stakeholders in a project and not a single amorphous user of the system. These different groups will be affected by the software being written in differing ways and will have a varying opinion of what quality in the system means to them. It’s for this reason that it’s important to understand who the software will be bringing value you and exactly what in it will be valuable to them.</p
><p
>Finally, BDD relies on automation. Once you’ve defined the quality expected, your team will likely want to check on the functionality of the solution being built regularly and compare it to the results they expect. In order to facilitate this efficiently, the process has to be automated. BDD relies heavily on the automation of specification-testing and Jasmine is a tool which can assist with this.</p
><p
>BDD helps both developers and non-technical stakeholders:</p
><ul
><li
  >Better understand and represent the models of the problems being solved</li
  ><li
  >Explain supported tests cases in a language that non-developers can read</li
  ><li
  >Focus on minimizing translation of the technical code being written and the domain language spoken by the business</li
  ></ul
><p
>What this means is that developers should be able to show Jasmine unit tests to a project stakeholder and (at a high level, thanks to a common vocabulary being used) they’ll ideally be able to understand what the code supports.</p
><p
>Developers often implement BDD in unison with another testing paradigm known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"
  >TDD</a
  > (test-driven development). The main idea behind TDD is:</p
><ul
><li
  >Write unit tests which describe the functionality you would like your code to support</li
  ><li
  >Watch these tests fail (as the code to support them hasn’t yet been written)</li
  ><li
  >Write code to make the tests pass</li
  ><li
  >Rinse, repeat and refactor</li
  ></ul
><p
>In this chapter we’re going to use both BDD (with TDD) to write unit tests for a Backbone application.</p
><p
><strong
  ><em
    >Note:</em
    ></strong
  > I’ve seen a lot of developers also opt for writing tests to validate behaviour of their code after having written it. While this is fine, note that it can come with pitfalls such as only testing for behaviour your code currently supports, rather than behaviour the problem needs to be supported.</p
><h2 id="suites-specs-spies"
><a href="#TOC"
  >Suites, Specs &amp; Spies</a
  ></h2
><p
>When using Jasmine, you’ll be writing suites and specifications (specs). Suites basically describe scenarios whilst specs describe what can be done in these scenarios.</p
>Each spec is a JavaScript function, described with a call to</pre><p
>it()`` using a description string and a function. The description should describe the behaviour the particular unit of code should exhibit and keeping in mind BDD, it should ideally be meaningful. Here’s an example of a basic spec:</p
><pre
><code
  >it('should be incrementing in value', function(){
    var counter = 0;
    counter++;  
});
</code
  ></pre
>On it’s own, a spec isn’t particularly useful until expectations are set about the behaviour of the code. Expectations in specs are defined using the</pre>expect()</pre> <p
>function and an <a href="https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/wiki/Matchers"
  >expectation matcher</a
  > (e.g toEqual(), toBeTruthy(), toContain()). A revised example using an expectation matcher would look like:</p
><pre
><code
  >it('should be incrementing in value', function(){
    var counter = 0;
    counter++;  
    expect(counter).toEqual(1);
});
</code
  ></pre
>The above code passes our behavioural expectation as</pre><p
>counter`` equals 1. Notice how easy this was to read the expectation on the last line (you probably grokked it without any explanation).</p
>Specs are grouped into suites which we describe using Jasmine’s</pre>describe()</pre> <p
>function, again passing a string as a description and a function. The name/description for your suite is typically that of the component or module you’re testing.</p
><p
>Jasmine will use it as the group name when it reports the results of the specs you’ve asked it to run. A simple suite containing our sample spec could look like:</p
><pre
><code
  >describe('Stats', function(){
    it('can increment a number', function(){
        ...
    });

    it('can subtract a number', function(){
        ...
    });
});
</code
  ></pre
><p
>Suites also share a functional scope and so it’s possible to declare variables and functions inside a describe block which are accessible within specs:</p
><pre
><code
  >describe('Stats', function(){
    var counter = 1;

    it('can increment a number', function(){
        // the counter was = 1
        counter = counter + 1;
        expect(counter).toEqual(2);
    });

    it('can subtract a number', function(){
        // the counter was = 2
        counter = counter + 3;
        expect(counter).toEqual(5);
    });
});
</code
  ></pre
><p
><strong
  ><em
    >Note:</em
    ></strong
  > Suites are executed in the order in which their are described, which can be useful to know if you would prefer to see test results for specific parts of your application reported first.</p
><p
>Jasmine also supports <strong
  >spies</strong
  > - a way to mock, spy and fake behaviour in our unit tests. Spies replace the function they’re spying on, allowing us to simulate behaviour we would like to mock (i.e test free of the actual implementation).</p
>In the below example, we’re spying on the</pre>setComplete</pre> <p
>method of a dummy Todo function to test that arguments can be passed to it as expected.</p
><pre
><code
  >var Todo = function(){
};

Todo.prototype.setComplete = function (arg){
    return arg;
}

describe('a simple spy', function(){
    it('should spy on an instance method of a Todo', function(){
        var myTodo = new Todo();
        spyOn(myTodo, 'setComplete');
        myTodo.setComplete('foo bar');

        expect(myTodo.setComplete).toHaveBeenCalledWith('foo bar');

        var myTodo2 = new Todo();
        spyOn(myTodo2, 'setComplete');

        expect(myTodo2.setComplete).not.toHaveBeenCalled();

    });
});
</code
  ></pre
><p
>What you’re more likely to use spies for is testing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_communication"
  >asynchronous</a
  > behaviour in your application such as AJAX requests. Jasmine supports:</p
><ul
><li
  >Writing tests which can mock AJAX requests using spies. This allows us to test code which runs before an AJAX request and right after. It’s also possible to mock/fake responses the server can return and the benefit of this type of testing is that it’s faster as no real calls are being made to a server</li
  ><li
  >Asynchronous tests which don’t rely on spies</li
  ></ul
><p
>For the first kind of test, it’s possible to both fake an AJAX request and verify that the request was both calling the correct URL and executed a callback where one was provided.</p
><pre
><code
  >it(&quot;the callback should be executed on success&quot;, function () {
    spyOn($, &quot;ajax&quot;).andCallFake(function(options) {
        options.success();
    });

    var callback = jasmine.createSpy();
    getTodo(15, callback);

    expect($.ajax.mostRecentCall.args[0][&quot;url&quot;]).toEqual(&quot;/todos/15&quot;);
    expect(callback).toHaveBeenCalled();
});

function getTodo(id, callback) {
    $.ajax({
        type: &quot;GET&quot;,
        url: &quot;/todos/&quot; + id,
        dataType: &quot;json&quot;,
        success: callback
    });
}
</code
  ></pre
>If you feel lost having seen matchers like</pre>andCallFake()</pre> and</pre>toHaveBeenCalled()</pre><p
>, don’t worry. All of these are Spy-specific matchers and are documented on the Jasmine <a href="https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/wiki/Spies"
  >wiki</a
  >.</p
><p
>For the second type of test (asynchronous tests), we can take the above further by taking advantage of three other methods Jasmine supports:</p
><ul
><li
  >runs(function) - a block which runs as if it was directly called</li
  ><li
  >waits(timeout) - a native timeout before the next block is run</li
  ><li
  ><p
    >waitsFor(function, optional message, optional timeout) - a way to pause specs until some other work has completed. Jasmine waits until the supplied function returns true here before it moves on to the next block.</p
    ><p
    >it(“should make an actual AJAX request to a server”, function () {</p
    ><pre
    ><code
      >var callback = jasmine.createSpy();
getTodo(16, callback);

waitsFor(function() {
    return callback.callCount &gt; 0;
});

runs(function() {
    expect(callback).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
</code
      ></pre
    ><p
    >});</p
    ><p
    >function getTodo(id, callback) { $.ajax({ type: “GET”, url: “todos.json”, dataType: “json”, success: callback }); }</p
    ></li
  ></ul
><p
><strong
  ><em
    >Note:</em
    ></strong
  > It’s useful to remember that when making real requests to a web server in your unit tests, this has the potential to massively slow down the speed at which tests run (due to many factors including server latency). As this also introduces an external dependency that can (and should) be minimised in your unit testing, it is strongly recommended that you opt for spies to remove the need for a web server to be used here.</p
><h2 id="beforeeach-and-aftereach"
><a href="#TOC"
  >beforeEach and afterEach()</a
  ></h2
>Jasmine also supports specifying code that can be run before each (</pre>beforeEach()</pre>) and after each (</pre>afterEach</pre>) test. This is useful for enforcing consistent conditions (such as resetting variables that may be required by specs). In the following example,</pre>beforeEach()</pre> <p
>is used to create a new sample Todo model specs can use for testing attributes.</p
><pre
><code
  >beforeEach(function(){
   this.todo = new Backbone.Model({
      text: &quot;Buy some more groceries&quot;,
      done: false 
   });

it(&quot;should contain a text value if not the default value&quot;, function(){
   expect(this.todo.get('text')).toEqual(&quot;Buy some more groceries&quot;); 
});

>Each nested</pre>describe()</pre> in your tests can have their own</pre>beforeEach()</pre> and</pre>afterEach()</pre> methods which support including setup and teardown methods relevant to a particular suite. We’ll be using</pre>beforeEach()</pre> <p
>in practice a little later.</p
><h2 id="shared-scope"
><a href="#TOC"
  >Shared scope</a
  ></h2
>In the previous section you may have noticed that we initially declared a variable</pre>this.todo</pre> in our</pre>beforeEach()</pre> call and were then able to continue using this in</pre>afterEach()</pre>.

  >TDD With Backbone</a
  ></h2
><p
>When developing applications with Backbone, it can be necessary to test both individual modules of code as well as modules, views, collections and routers. Taking a TDD approach to testing, let’s review some specs for testing these Backbone components using the popular Backbone <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc/tree/master/todo-example/backbone"
  >Todo</a
  > application.</p
><p
>I would like to extend my thanks to Larry Myers for his <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-koans"
  >Koans</a
  > project which both greatly helped here and will be used in the exercise portion of this chapter.</p
><h2 id="models-1"
><a href="#TOC"
  >Models</a
  ></h2
><p
>The complexity of Backbone models can vary greatly depending on what your application is trying to achieve. In the following example, we’re going to test default values, attributes, state changes and validation rules.</p
>First, we begin our suite for model testing using</pre>describe()</pre><p
>:</p
><pre
><code
  >describe('Tests for Todo', function() {
</code
  ></pre
><p
>Models should ideally have default values for attributes. This helps ensure that when creating instances without a value set for any specific attribute, a default one (e.g “”) is used instead. The idea here is to allow your application to interact with models without any unexpected behaviour.</p
>In the following spec, we create a new Todo without any attributes passed then check to find out what the value of the</pre>text</pre> attribute is. As no value has been set, we expect a default value of</pre><p
>“”`` to be returned.</p
><pre
><code
  >it('Can be created with default values for its attributes.', function() {
    var todo = new Todo();
    expect(todo.get('text')).toBe(&quot;&quot;);
});
</code
  ></pre
>If testing this spec before your models have been written, you’ll incur a failing test, as expected. What’s required for the spec to pass is a default value for the attribute</pre>text</pre><p
>. We can implement this default value with some other useful defaults (which we’ll be using shortly) in our Todo model as follows:</p
><pre
><code
  >window.Todo = Backbone.Model.extend({

    defaults: function() {
        return {
            text: &quot;&quot;,
            done:  false,
            order: 0
        };
    }
</code
  ></pre
>Next, we want to test that our model will pass attributes that are set such that retrieving the value of these attributes after initialization will be what we expect. Notice that here, in addition to testing for an expected value for</pre>text</pre><p
>, we’re also testing the other default values are what we expect them to be.</p
><pre
><code
  >it('Will set passed attributes on the model instance when created.', function() {
    var todo = new Todo({ text: 'Get oil change for car.' });

    // what are the values expected here for each of the
    // attributes in our Todo?

    expect(todo.get('text')).toBe(&quot;Get oil change for car.&quot;);
    expect(todo.get('done')).toBe(false);
    expect(todo.get('order')).toBe(0);
});
</code
  ></pre
><p
>Backbone models support a model.change() event which is triggered when the state of a model changes. In the following example, by ‘state’ I’m referring to the value of a Todo model’s attributes. The reason changes of state are important to test are that there may be state-dependant events in your application e.g you may wish to display a confirmation view once a Todo model has been updated.</p
><pre
><code
  >it('Fires a custom event when the state changes.', function() {

    var spy = jasmine.createSpy('-change event callback-');

    var todo = new Todo();

    // how do we monitor changes of state?
    todo.bind('change', spy);

    // what would you need to do to force a change of state?
    todo.set({ text: 'Get oil change for car.' });

    expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
</code
  ></pre
>It’s common to include validation logic in your models to ensure both the input passed from users (and other modules) in the application are ‘valid’. A Todo app may wish to validate the text input supplied in case it contains rude words. Similarly if we’re storing the</pre>done</pre> <p
>state of a Todo item using booleans, we need to validate that truthy/falsy values are passed and not just any arbitrary string.</p
><p
>In the following spec, we take advantage of the fact that validations which fail model.validate() trigger an “error” event. This allows us to test if validations are correctly failing when invalid input is supplied.</p
>We create an errorCallback spy using Jasmine’s built in</pre>createSpy()</pre> <p
>method which allows us to spy on the error event as follows:</p

  >Collections</a
  ></h2
><p
>We now need to define specs to tests a Backbone collection of Todo models (a TodoList). Collections are responsible for a number of list tasks including managing order and filtering.</p
><p
>A few specific specs that come to mind when working with collections are:</p
><ul
><li
  >Making sure we can add new Todo models as both objects and arrays</li
  ><li
  >Attribute testing to make sure attributes such as the base URL of the collection are values we expect</li
  ><li
  >Purposefully adding items with a status of</pre>done:true</pre> and checking against how many the collection thinks have been completed vs. those that are remaining</li
  ></ul
><p
>In this section we’re going to cover the first two of these with the third left as an extended exercise I recommend trying out.</p
><p
>Testing Todo models can be added to a collection as objects or arrays is relatively trivial. First, we initialize a new TodoList collection and check to make sure it’s length (i.e the number of Todo models it contains) is 0. Next, we add new Todos, both as objects and arrays, checking the length property of the collection at each stage to ensure the overall count is what we expect:</p
><pre
><code
  >describe('Tests for TodoList', function() {

    it('Can add Model instances as objects and arrays.', function() {
        var todos = new TodoList();

        expect(todos.length).toBe(0);

        todos.add({ text: 'Clean the kitchen' });

        // how many todos have been added so far?
        expect(todos.length).toBe(1);

        todos.add([
            { text: 'Do the laundry', done: true }, 
            { text: 'Go to the gym'}
        ]);

        // how many are there in total now?
        expect(todos.length).toBe(3);
    });
...
</code
  ></pre
><p
>Similar to model attributes, it’s also quite straight-forward to test attributes in collections. Here we have a spec that ensures the collection.url (i.e the url reference to the collection’s location on the server) is what we expect it to be:</p
><pre
><code
  >it('Can have a url property to define the basic url structure for all contained models.', function() {
        var todos = new TodoList();

        // what has been specified as the url base in our model?
        expect(todos.url).toBe('/todos/');
});
</code
  ></pre
>For the third spec, it’s useful to remember that the implementation for our collection will have methods for filtering how many Todo items are done and how many are remaining - we can call these</pre>done()</pre> and</pre>remaining()</pre>. Consider writing a spec which creates a new collection and adds one new model that has a preset</pre>done</pre> state of</pre>true</pre> and two others that have the default</pre>done</pre> state of</pre>false</pre>. Testing the length of what’s returned using</pre>done()</pre> and</pre>remaining()</pre> <p
>should allow us to know whether the state management in our application is working or needs a little tweaking.</p
><p
>The final implementation for our TodoList collection can be found below:</p
><pre
><code
  > window.TodoList = Backbone.Collection.extend({

        model: Todo,

        url: '/todos/',

        done: function() {
            return this.filter(function(todo) { return todo.get('done'); });
        },

        remaining: function() {
            return this.without.apply(this, this.done());
        },

        nextOrder: function() {
            if (!this.length) { 
                return 1; 
            }

            return this.last().get('order') + 1;

>Before we take a look at testing Backbone views, let’s briefly review a jQuery plugin that can assist with writing Jasmine specs for them.</p
><p
><strong
  >The Jasmine jQuery Plugin</strong
  ></p
><p
>As we know our Todo application will be using jQuery for DOM manipulation, there’s a useful jQuery plugin called <a href="https://github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery"
  >jasmine-jquery</a
  > we can use to help simplify BDD testing rendered elements that our views may produce.</p
><p
>The plugin provides a number of additional Jasmine <a href="https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/wiki/Matchers"
  >matchers</a
  > to help test jQuery wrapped sets such as:</p
><ul
><li
  ></pre>toBe(jQuerySelector)</pre> e.g</pre>expect($(’<div id="some-id"></div>’)).toBe(‘div#some-id’)</pre></li
  ><li
  ></pre>toBeChecked()</pre> e.g</pre>expect($(‘<input type="checkbox" checked="checked"/>’)).toBeChecked()</pre></li
  ><li
  ></pre>toBeSelected()</pre> e.g</pre>expect($(‘<option selected="selected"></option>’)).toBeSelected()</pre>
</li
  ></ul
><p
>and <a href="https://github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery"
  >many others</a
  >. The complete list of matchers supported can be found on the project homepage. It’s useful to know that similar to the standard Jasmine matchers, the custom matchers above can be inverted using the .not prefix (i.e <code
  >expect(x).not.toBe(y)</code
  >:</p
><p
><code
  >expect($('&lt;div&gt;I am an example&lt;/div&gt;')).not.toHaveText(/other/)</code
  ></p
><p
>jasmine-jquery also includes a fixtures model, allowing us to load in arbitrary HTML content we may wish to use in our tests. Fixtures can be used as follows:</p
><p
>Include some HTML in an external fixtures file:</p
><p
>some.fixture.html: <code
  >&lt;div id=&quot;sample-fixture&quot;&gt;some HTML content&lt;/div&gt;</code
  ></p
><p
>Next, inside our actual test we would load it as follows:</p
><pre
><code
  >loadFixtures('some.fixture.html')
$('some-fixture').myTestedPlugin();
expect($('#some-fixture')).to&lt;the rest of your matcher would go here&gt;
</code
  ></pre
>The jasmine-jquery plugin is by default setup to load fixtures from a specific directory: spec/javascripts/fixtures. If you wish to configure this path you can do so by initially setting</pre>jasmine.getFixtures().fixturesPath = ‘your custom path’</pre><p
>.</p
>Finally, jasmine-jquery includes support for spying on jQuery events without the need for any extra plumbing work. This can be done using the</pre>spyOnEvent()</pre> and</pre>assert(eventName).toHaveBeenTriggered(selector)</pre> <p
>functions. An example of usage may look as follows:</p
><pre
><code
  >spyOnEvent($('#el'), 'click');
$('#el').click();
expect('click').toHaveBeenTriggeredOn($('#el'));
</code
  ></pre
><p
><strong
  >View testing</strong
  ></p
><p
>In this section we will review three dimensions to writing specs for Backbone Views: initial setup, view rendering and finally templating. The latter two of these are the most commonly tested, however we’ll review shortly why writing specs for the initialization of your views can also be of benefit.</p
><h2 id="initial-setup"
><a href="#TOC"
  >Initial setup</a
  ></h2
><p
>At their most basic, specs for Backbone views should validate that they are being correctly tied to specific DOM elements and are backed by valid data models. The reason to consider doing this is that failures to such specs can trip up more complex tests later on and they’re fairly simple to write, given the overall value offered.</p
>To help ensure a consistant testing setup for our specs, we use</pre>beforeEach()</pre> to append both an empty</pre>UL</pre> (#todoList) to the DOM and initialize a new instance of a TodoView using an empty Todo model.</pre>afterEach()</pre> is used to remove the previous #todoList</pre>UL</pre> <p
>as well as the previous instance of the view.</p
><pre
><code
  >describe('Tests for TodoView', function() {

    beforeEach(function() {
        $('body').append('&lt;ul id=&quot;todoList&quot;&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;');
        this.todoView = new TodoView({ model: new Todo() });
    });


    afterEach(function() {
        this.todoView.remove();
        $('#todoList').remove();
    });

...
</code
  ></pre
>The first spec useful to write is a check that the TodoView we’ve created is using the correct</pre>tagName</pre> <p
>(element or className). The purpose of this test is to make sure it’s been correctly tied to a DOM element when it was created.</p
><p
>Backbone views typically create empty DOM elements once initialized, however these elements are not attached to the visible DOM in order to allow them to be constructed without an impact on the performance of rendering.</p
><pre
><code
  >it('Should be tied to a DOM element when created, based off the property provided.', function() {
    //what html element tag name represents this view?
    expect(todoView.el.tagName.toLowerCase()).toBe('li');
});
</code
  ></pre

>.</p
><pre
><code
  >var todoView = Backbone.View.extend({
    tagName:  &quot;li&quot;
});
</code
  ></pre
>If instead of testing against the</pre>tagName</pre> you would prefer to use a className instead, we can take advantage of jasmine-jquery’s</pre>toHaveClass()</pre> <p
>matcher to cater for this.</p
><pre
><code
  >it('Should have a class of &quot;todos&quot;'), function(){
   expect($(this.view.el)).toHaveClass('todos');
});
</code
  ></pre
>The</pre>toHaveClass()</pre> <p
>matcher operates on jQuery objects and if the plugin hadn’t been used, an exception would have been incurred (it is of course also possible to test for the className by accessing el.className if not opting to use jasmine-jquery).</p
>You may have noticed that in</pre>beforeEach()</pre>, we passed our view an initial (albeit unfilled) Todo model. Views should be backed by a model instance which provides data. As this is quite important to our view’s ability to function, we can write a spec to ensure a model is both defined (using the</pre>toBeDefined()</pre> <p
>matcher) and then test attributes of the model to ensure defaults both exist and are the value we expect them to be.</p
><pre
><code
  >it('Is backed by a model instance, which provides the data.', function() {

    expect(todoView.model).toBeDefined();

    // what's the value for Todo.get('done') here?

><a href="#TOC"
  >View rendering</a
  ></h2
><p
>Next we’re going to take a look at writing specs for view rendering. Specifically, we want to test that our TodoView elements are actually rendering as expected.</p
><p
>In smaller applications, those new to BDD might argue that visual confirmation of view rendering could replace unit testing of views. The reality is that when dealing with applications that might grow to multiple-views, it often makes sense to automate this process as much as possible from the get-go. There are also aspects of rendering that require verification beyond what is visually presented on-screen (which we’ll see very shortly).</p
>We’re going to begin testing views by writing two specs. The first spec will check that the view’s</pre>render()</pre> <p
>method is correctly returning the view instance, which is necessary for chaining. Our second spec will check that the HTML produced is exactly what we expect based on the properties of the model instance that’s been associated with our TodoView.</p
>Unlike some of the previous specs we’ve covered, this section will make greater use of</pre>beforeEach()</pre> <p
>to both demonstrate how to use nested suites and also ensure a consistant set of conditions for our specs. In our first view spec for TodoView, we’re simply going to create a sample model (based on Todo) and instantiate a TodoView which associates it with the model.</p
><pre
><code
  >describe(&quot;TodoView&quot;, function() {

  beforeEach(function() {
    this.model = new Backbone.Model({
      text: &quot;My Todo&quot;,
      order: 1,
      done: false
    });
    this.view = new TodoView({model:this.model});

    it(&quot;produces the correct HTML&quot;, function() {
      this.view.render();

      //let's use jasmine-jquery's toContain() to avoid
      //testing for the complete content of a todo's markup
      expect(this.view.el.innerHTML)
        .toContain('&lt;label class=&quot;todo-content&quot;&gt;My Todo&lt;/label&gt;');
    });

  });

});
</code
  ></pre
>Once these specs are run, only the second one (‘produces the correct HTML’) fails. Our first spec (‘returns the view object’), which is testing that the TodoView instance is returned from</pre>render()</pre>, only passed as this is Backbone’s default behaviour. We haven’t yet overwritten the</pre>render()</pre> <p
>method with our own version.</p
><p
><strong
  >Note:</strong
  > For the purposes of maintaining readability, all template examples in this section will use a minimal version of the following Todo view template. As it’s relatively trivial to expand this, please feel free to refer to this sample if needed:</p
><pre
><code
  >&lt;div class=&quot;todo &lt;%= done ? 'done' : '' %&gt;&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;display&quot;&gt;
          &lt;input class=&quot;check&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; &lt;%= done ? 'checked=&quot;checked&quot;' : '' %&gt; /&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;todo-content&quot;&gt;&lt;%= content %&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;todo-destroy&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;edit&quot;&gt;
          &lt;input class=&quot;todo-input&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; value=&quot;&lt;%= content %&gt;&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code
  ></pre
><p
>The second spec fails with the following message:</p
>Expected ’’ to contain</pre>‘<label class="todo-content">My Todo</label>’</pre><p
>.</p
><p
>The reason for this is the default behaviour for render() doesn’t create any markup. Let’s write a replacement for render() which fixes this:</p
><pre
><code
  >render: function() {
  var template = '&lt;label class=&quot;todo-content&quot;&gt;&lt;%= text %&gt;&lt;/label&gt;';
  var output = template
    .replace(&quot;&lt;%= text %&gt;&quot;, this.model.get('text'));
  $(this.el).html(output);
  return this;
}
</code
  ></pre
><p
>The above specifies an inline string template and replaces fields found in the template within the “&lt;% %&gt;” blocks with their corresponding values from the associated model. As we’re now also returning the TodoView instance from the method, the first spec will also pass. It’s worth noting that there are serious drawbacks to using HTML strings in your specs to test against like this. Even minor changes to your template (a simple tab or whitespace) would cause your spec to fail, despite the rendered output being the same. It’s also more time consuming to maintain as most templates in real-world applications are significantly more complex. A better option for testing rendered output is using jQuery to both select and inspect values.</p
><p
>With this in mind, let’s re-write the specs, this time using some of the custom matchers offered by jasmine-jquery:</p
><pre
><code
  >describe(&quot;Template&quot;, function() {

  beforeEach(function() {
    this.view.render();
  });

  it(&quot;has the correct text content&quot;, function() {
    expect($(this.view.el).find('todo-content'))
      .toHaveText('My Todo');
  });

});
</code
  ></pre
><p
>It would be impossible to discuss unit testing without mentioning fixtures. Fixtures typically contain test data (e.g HTML) that is loaded in when needed (either locally or from an external file) for unit testing. So far we’ve been establishing jQuery expectations based on the view’s el property. This works for a number of cases, however, there are instances where it may be necessary to render markup into the document. The most optimal way to handle this within specs is through using fixtures (another feature brought to us by the jasmine-jquery plugin).</p
><p
>Re-writing the last spec to use fixtures would look as follows:</p
><pre
><code
  >describe(&quot;TodoView&quot;, function() {

  beforeEach(function() {
    ...
    setFixtures('&lt;ul class=&quot;todos&quot;&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;');
  });

  ...

  describe(&quot;Template&quot;, function() {

    beforeEach(function() {
      $('.todos').append(this.view.render().el);
    });

    it(&quot;has the correct text content&quot;, function() {
      expect($('.todos').find('.todo-content'))
        .toHaveText('My Todo');
    });

  });

});
</code
  ></pre
>What we’re now doing in the above spec is appending the rendered todo item into the fixture. We then set expectations against the fixture, which may be something desirable when a view is setup against an element which already exists in the DOM. It would be necessary to provide both the fixture and test the</pre>el</pre> <p
>property correctly picking up the element expected when the view is instantiated.</p
><h2 id="rendering-with-a-templating-system"
><a href="#TOC"
  >Rendering with a templating system</a
  ></h2
><p
>JavaScript templating systems (such as Handlebars, Mustache and even Underscore’s own Micro-templating) support conditional logic in template strings. What this effectively means is that we can add if/else/ternery expressions inline which can then be evaluated as needed, allowing us to build even more powerful templates.</p
><p
>In our case, when a user sets a Todo item to be complete (done), we may wish to provide them with visual feedback (such as a striked line through the text) to differenciate the item from those that are remaining. This can be done by attaching a new class to the item. Let’s begin by writing a test we would ideally like to work:</p
><pre
><code
  >describe(&quot;When a todo is done&quot;, function() {

  beforeEach(function() {
    this.model.set({done: true}, {silent: true});
    $('.todos').append(this.view.render().el);
  });

  it(&quot;has a done class&quot;, function() {
    expect($('.todos .todo-content:first-child'))
      .toHaveClass(&quot;done&quot;);
  });

});
</code
  ></pre
><p
>This will fail with the following message:</p
><p
>Expected <code
  >&lt;label class=&quot;todo-content&quot;&gt;My Todo&lt;/label&gt;</code
  > to have class ‘done’.</p
><p
>which can be fixed in the existing render() method as follows:</p
><pre
><code
  >render: function() {
  var template = '&lt;label class=&quot;todo-content&quot;&gt;' +
    '&lt;%= text %&gt;&lt;/label&gt;';
  var output = template
    .replace(&quot;&lt;%= text %&gt;&quot;, this.model.get('text'));
  $(this.el).html(output);
  if (this.model.get('done')) {
    this.$(&quot;.todo-content&quot;).addClass(&quot;done&quot;);
  }
  return this;
}
</code
  ></pre
><p
>This can however get unweildly fairly quickly. As the logic in our templates increases, so does the complexity involved. This is where templates libraries can help. As mentioned earlier, there are a number of popular options available, but for the purposes of this chapter we’re going to stick to using Underscore’s built-in Microtemplating. Whilst there are more advanced options you’re free to explore, the benefit of this is that no additional files are required and we can easily change the existing Jasmine specs without too much adjustment.</p
><p
>The TodoView object modified to use Underscore templating would look as follows:</p
><pre
><code
  >var TodoView = Backbone.View.extend({

  tagName: &quot;li&quot;,

  initialize: function(options) {
    this.template = _.template(options.template || &quot;&quot;);
  },

  render: function() {
    $(this.el).html(this.template(this.model.toJSON()));
    return this;
  },

  ...

});
</code
  ></pre
><p
>Above, the initialize() method compiles a supplied Underscore template (using the _.template() function) in the instantiation. A more common way of referencing templates is placing them in a script tag using a custom script type (e.g type=“text/template”). As this isn’t a script type any browser understands, it’s simply ignored, however referencing the script by an id attribute allows the template to be kept separate to other parts of the page which wish to use it. In real world applications, it’s preferable to either do this or load in templates stored in external files for testing.</p
><p
>For testing purposes, we’re going to continue using the string injection approach to keep things simple. There is however a useful trick that can be applied to automatically create or extend teamplates in the Jasmine scope for each test. By creating a new directory (say, ‘templates’) in the ‘spec’ folder and adding a new script file with the following contents, to jasmine.yml or SpecRunner.html, we can add a todo property which contains the Underscore template we wish to use:</p
><pre
><code
  >beforeEach(function() {
  this.templates = _.extend(this.templates || {}, {
    todo: '&lt;label class=&quot;todo-content&quot;&gt;' +
            '&lt;%= text %&gt;' +
          '&lt;/label&gt;'
  });
});
</code
  ></pre
><p
>To finish this off, we simply update our existing spec to reference the template when instantiating the TodoView object:</p
><pre
><code
  >describe(&quot;TodoView&quot;, function() {

  beforeEach(function() {
    ...
    this.view = new TodoView({
      model: this.model,
      template: this.templates.todo
    });
  });

  ...

});
</code
  ></pre
><p
>The existing specs we’ve looked at would continue to pass using this approach, leaving us free to adjust the template with some additional conditional logic for Todos with a status of ‘done’:</p
><pre
><code
  >beforeEach(function() {
  this.templates = _.extend(this.templates || {}, {
    todo: '&lt;label class=&quot;todo-content &lt;%= done ? 'done' : '' %&gt;&quot;' +
            '&lt;%= text %&gt;' +
          '&lt;/label&gt;'
  });
});
</code
  ></pre
>This will now also pass without any issues. Remember that jasmine-jquery also supports loading external fixtures into your specs easily using it’s build in</pre>loadFixtures()</pre> and</pre>readFixtures()</pre> <p
>methods. For more information, consider reading the official jasmine-jquery <a href="https://github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery"

  >: I’ve linked to this book’s fork of Koans in case any project-specific changes are required, however, in case you would like to check out the original project on GitHub, please feel <a href="https://github.com/larrymyers/backbone-koans"
